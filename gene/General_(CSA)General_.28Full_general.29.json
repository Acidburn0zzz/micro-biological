They were often former officers from the United States Army\n(the regular army) prior to the Civil War, while others were given the rank\nbased on merit or when necessity demanded. Most Confederate generals needed\nconfirmation from the Confederate Congress, much like prospective generals in\nthe modern U.S. armed forces.\n\nLike all of the Confederacy's military forces, these generals answered to\ntheir civilian leadership, in particular Jefferson Davis, the South's\npresident and therefore commander-in-chief of the Army, Navy, and Marines of\nthe Confederate States.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"General_(CSA)#General_.28Full_general.29","recorded":1376427968,"links":[],"instances":["united_states","general","military","general","united_states","confederate_army_officer","general","military"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Confederate States Army generals|","Confederate States Army","Lists of American military personnel","Lists of the American Civil War"],"headings":["History","Brigadier general","Major general","Lieutenant general","General (Full general)","General-in-Chief","Militia generals","Uniform insignia","Pay","Legacy","See also","Notes","References","Further reading"],"image":[],"tags":[["regular_army","united_states"],["samuel_cooper","general"],["colonel","united_states"],["division","military"],["benjamin_huger","general"],["sam_jones","confederate_army_officer"],["brevet","military"],["pine_mountain","cobb_county,_georgia"],["richard_taylor","general"],["samuel_cooper","general"],["samuel_cooper","general"]],"members":["regular_army","richard_taylor","pine_mountain","division","benjamin_huger","colonel","sam_jones","samuel_cooper","brevet"],"related":["Confederate_States_Army","Confederate_States_of_America","American_Civil_War","United_States_Army","Regular_Army_(United_States)","Congress_of_the_Confederate_States","General_officer","Jefferson_Davis","President_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America","Commander-in-chief","Confederate_States_Navy","Confederate_States_Marine_Corps","Southern_United_States","Militia","United_States_Military_Academy","Mexican-American_War","Union_Army","Political_general","Adjutant_general","Quartermaster_general","Commissariat","Surgeon_General_of_the_United_States_Navy","Samuel_Cooper_(general)","Colonel_(United_States)","Inspector_general","Infantry","Artillery","Brigade","Robert_E._Lee","Joseph_E._Johnston","Regiment","Colonel","Division_(military)","Northern_United_States","David_E._Twiggs","Earl_Van_Dorn","Spring_Hill,_Tennessee","Gustavus_Woodson_Smith","Benjamin_Huger_(general)","John_B._Magruder","Mansfield_Lovell","George_B._Crittenden","William_W._Loring","Sterling_Price","Benjamin_F._Cheatham","David_Rumph_Jones","John_P._McCown","Sam_Jones_(Confederate_Army_officer)","Daniel_Harvey_Hill","Jones_M._Withers","Thomas_C._Hindman","John_C._Breckinridge","Lafayette_McLaws","J.E.B._Stuart","Mortal_wound","Battle_of_Yellow_Tavern","Samuel_Gibbs_French","George_Pickett","Carter_L._Stevenson","John_H._Forney","Patrick_Cleburne","Killed_in_action","Battle_of_Franklin","Corps","Military_district","Ulysses_S._Grant","Brevet_(military)","Richard_H._Anderson","First_Corps,_Army_of_Northern_Virginia","James_Longstreet","Battle_of_the_Wilderness","Jubal_Anderson_Early","Second_Corps,_Army_of_Northern_Virginia","Richard_S._Ewell","Stephen_D._Lee","Alexander_P._Stewart","Western_Theater_of_the_American_Civil_War","James_Longstreet","Edmund_Kirby_Smith","Leonidas_Polk","Killed_in_action","Pine_Mountain_(Cobb_County,_Georgia)","Theophilus_H._Holmes","Stonewall_Jackson","Battle_of_Chancellorsville","John_C._Pemberton","Richard_S._Ewell","A._P._Hill","Siege_of_Petersburg","John_Bell_Hood","Richard_Taylor_(general)","Jubal_Anderson_Early","Richard_H._Anderson","Alexander_P._Stewart","Stephen_D._Lee","Simon_Bolivar_Buckner,_Sr.","Wade_Hampton_III","Nathan_Bedford_Forrest","Field_army","Edmund_Kirby_Smith","P._G._T._Beauregard","Samuel_Cooper_(general)","Albert_Sidney_Johnston","Robert_E._Lee","Joseph_E._Johnston","P.G.T._Beauregard","Trans-Mississippi_Theater_of_the_American_Civil_War","Braxton_Bragg","John_Bell_Hood","Army_of_Tennessee","Atlanta_Campaign","Samuel_Cooper_(general)","Albert_Sidney_Johnston","Battle_of_Shiloh","Robert_E._Lee","Joseph_E._Johnston","P._G._T._Beauregard","Braxton_Bragg","Edmund_Kirby_Smith","American_Revolutionary_War","Joseph_R._Anderson","Confederate_States_of_America_dollar","Aide-de-camp","Stonewall_Jackson","Friendly_fire","Battle_of_Chancellorsville","John_Bell_Hood","George_Pickett","Richard_S._Ewell","Stand_Watie","Edmund_Kirby_Smith","United_States_Marine_Corps","World_War_II","List_of_American_Civil_War_generals","General_officers_in_the_United_States","David_J._Eicher","Shelby_Foote","Marcus_Joseph_Wright","Clement_A._Evans"]}
