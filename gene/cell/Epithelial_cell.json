Epithelial tissues line the cavities and\nsurfaces of structures throughout the body, and also form many glands. Functions\nof epithelial cells include secretion, selective absorption, protection,\ntranscellular transport and detection of sensation. In Greek \"á¼ÏÎ¯\" (\"epi\") means\n\"on\" or \"upon\", and \"Î¸Î·Î»Î®\" (\"thÄlÄ\") means\n\"nipple\". [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epithelium Epitheium at\nWiktionary] Epithelial layers are avascular, so they must receive\nnourishment via diffusion of substances from the underlying connective tissue,\nthrough the basement membrane.
