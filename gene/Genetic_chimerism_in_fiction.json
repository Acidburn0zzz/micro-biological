Most known examples are subsequent to the 2004 book [[Free Culture\n(book)|Free Culture]], where author Lawrence Lessig digresses briefly\nto describe chimerism and suggest that it could, and had yet to, be well used as\na television plot device (particularly for police procedurals involving genetic\nfingerprinting). *In Kathy Reichs' novel, Spider Bones, after an incorrect\nidentification of a deceased Vietnam soldier, Dr. Brennan discovers that his\nmother was a chimera, explaining why their DNA did not match. *The [[CSI: Crime\nScene Investigation]] episode \"Bloodlines\" involves a man who rapes a woman and\nis identified by her, but the DNA from his semen doesn't match to the DNA from\nhis saliva because he is a chimera. *In the [[House (TV series)|House]] episode\n\"Cane and Able\", a boy who believes he was abducted by aliens is diagnosed with\nchimerism. *In an episode of [[The Office (US TV series)|The Office]], Dwight\nSchrute says that he resorbed his twin brother while in his mother's womb. He\nalso says that he now has \"the strength of a grown man and a little baby\". *A\nNovember 2006 episode of the ABC soap opera [[All My Children]] revealed that\nthe testing of a young character's DNA did not turn up a match with her mother,\nAnnie, because the character of Annie is a chimera. *One of the subplots in\nMichael Crichton's 2006 novel [[Next (novel)|Next]] deals with chimerism. *In\nseason three of the TV series [[ReGenesis]], a girl accused of murder is found\nnot guilty when DNA from her blood does not match the DNA found on the victim.\nShe is later proven to be the killer when DNA from her saliva is shown to match\nthat at the scene of the crime. The discrepancy between her blood and saliva is\nexplained by her being a chimera. *In the PlayStation 3 games and its sequel\nResistance 2, by Insomniac Games, the monsters were referred to as Chimera due\nto their combination of human and alien DNA. *A March 2008 Radio Lab episode\nexplored the case of a human\nchimera. [http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2008/03/14 WNYC -\nRadiolab: (So-Called) Life (March 14, 2008) ]\n*In the [[30 Rock]] episode \"MILF Island\", the character Liz Lemon says that she\nused to have deformed baby foot which was thought to be the result of her eating\nher twin while her mother, Margaret Lemon, was pregnant. *In the Stephen King\nnovel \"The Dark Half\" Thad Beaumont the main character suffers from intense\nmigraine headaches as a child. When on the operating table, his doctors find a\nhuman eye, ear and part of a nose growing inside Thad's skull, which was the\ncause of his headaches. The doctors explained this as Thad having absorbed his\ntwin prior to birth. *In the TV Series \"Dark Angel\" the Chimera theme was used\nwith the main character, Max, having feline DNA. *The 1991 Anglia TV (UK) drama\n[[Chimera (TV series)|Chimera]] centered on the creation/consequences of a\nhuman/ape Chimera. *Chimeras appear frequently in the Thursday Next science\nfiction novels written by Jasper Fforde. They are the result of home genetic\nengineering kits. *In the ebook The Chimera Chronicles: The Future of Change,\nDr. Cambio may have extended his life and that of his wife's by combining their\nDNA with another long-lived animal.  [http://www.alvisbooks.com/books.html\nAlvis Books]  *Vonda McIntyre's novella Screwtop (1976) features a\ngenetically engineered \"tetraparental\" (four parents) character who has black-and-\nfair streaked skin, as well as black-and-blond streaked hair.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction","recorded":1376421951,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Chimera_(genetics)","/wiki/Genetic_fingerprinting","/wiki/Free_Culture_(book)","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig","/wiki/Television","/wiki/Police_procedural","/wiki/Kathy_Reichs","/wiki/CSI:_Crime_Scene_Investigation","/wiki/Bloodlines_(CSI_episode)","/wiki/House_(TV_series)","/wiki/Cane_and_Able_(House_episode)","/wiki/The_Office_(US_TV_series)","/wiki/Dwight_Schrute","/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company","/wiki/All_My_Children","/wiki/Annie_Lavery","/wiki/Michael_Crichton","/wiki/Next_(novel)","/wiki/ReGenesis","/wiki/PlayStation_3","/wiki/Resistance:_Fall_of_Man","/wiki/Resistance_2","/wiki/Insomniac_Games","/wiki/Radio_Lab","#cite_note-2","/wiki/30_Rock","/wiki/MILF_Island","/wiki/Liz_Lemon","/wiki/Stephen_King","/wiki/The_Dark_Half","/wiki/Dark_Angel_(TV_series)","/wiki/Anglia_TV","/w/index.php?title=Chimera_(TV_series)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Jasper_Fforde","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Vonda_McIntyre","/w/index.php?title=Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig","http://www.free-culture.cc/freeculture.pdf","/wiki/Free_Culture_(book)","#cite_ref-2","http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2008/03/14","#cite_ref-3","http://www.alvisbooks.com/books.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction&oldid=524661134","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Personal_identification_documents","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Genetic+chimerism+in+fiction&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Genetic+chimerism+in+fiction","/wiki/Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction","/wiki/Talk:Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction","#","/wiki/Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction","/w/index.php?title=Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction&oldid=524661134","/w/index.php?title=Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5532882","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction&id=524661134","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Genetic+chimerism+in+fiction","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Genetic+chimerism+in+fiction&oldid=524661134&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5532882#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wik
