{"cursor":"28932","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In molecular biology, 'Housekeeping genes' are typically constitutive genes that\nare required for the maintenance of basic cellular function, and are expressed\nin all cells of an organism under normal and patho-physiological conditions. Although some housekeeping genes\n(such as GAPDH, HSP90, and Î²-actin) are expressed at relatively constant levels\nin most non-pathological situations, other housekeeping genes may vary depending\non experimental conditions.\n\nIn a study involving cardiac stem cells, ACTB and GAPDH were found to be the\nmost consistent, while Î²2M, HPRT1, and RPLP1 varied significantly between\nneonatal and adult cardiac cells. The origin of the term\n\"housekeeping gene\" remains obscure. Literature from 1976 used the term to\ndescribe specifically tRNA and rRNA. Interpreting gene\nexpression data can be problematic, with most human genes registering 5-10\ncopies per cell (possibly representing error). Housekeeping genes are expressed\nin at least 25 copies per cell and sometimes number in the thousands.\n","linknr":1611,"url":"Housekeeping_gene","recorded":1376418954,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Housekeeping_gene&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Housekeeping_gene&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Molecular_biology","/wiki/Constitutive_gene","/wiki/Gene_expression","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","#cite_note-Butte-2","/wiki/GAPDH","/wiki/HSP90","/wiki/Beta-actin","#cite_note-Greer-3","/wiki/ACTB","/wiki/GAPDH","/wiki/Beta-2_microglobulin","/wiki/HPRT1","/wiki/RPLP1","#cite_note-Tan-4","/wiki/TRNA","/wiki/RRNA","#cite_note-oldest-5","#Common_housekeeping_genes_in_human","#Gene_Expression","#Transcription_Factors","#Repressors","#RNA_Splicing","#Translation_Factors","#tRNA_Synthetases","#RNA_Binding_Protein","#Ribosomal_Proteins","#RNA_Polymerase","#Protein_Processing","#Heat_Shock_Proteins","#Histone","#Cell_Cycle","#Apoptosis","#Oncogenes","#DNA_Repair.2FReplication","#Metabolism","#Carbohydrate_Metabolism","#Citric_Acid_Cycle","#Lipid_Metabolism","#Amino_Acid_Metabolism","#Nucleotide_Synthesis","#NADH_Dehydrogenase","#Cytochrome_C_Oxidase","#ATPase","#Mitochondrial","#Lysosomal","#Lysosome","#Proteosome","#Ribonuclease","#Oxidase.2FReductase","#Structural","#Cytoskeletal","#Organelle_Synthesis","#Mitochondrion","#Surface","#Cell_Adhesion","#Channels_and_Transporters","#Receptors","#HLA.2FImmunoglobulin.2FCell_recognition","#Kinases.2FSignalling","#Growth_Factors","#Tissue_Necrosis_Factor","#Casein_Kinase","#Miscellaneous","#Open_reading_frame","#Sperm.2FTestis","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Housekeeping_gene&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Housekeeping_gene&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Housekeeping_gene&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/File:Protein_SREBF1_PDB_1am9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Protein_SREBF1_PDB_1am9.png/250px-Protein_SREBF1_PDB_1am9.png","/wiki/File:Protein_SREBF1_PDB_1am9.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/ATF4","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","#cite_note-everycell-6","/wiki/BTF3","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","#cite_note-everycell-6","/wiki/E2F4","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/wiki/ERH_(gene)","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","#cite_note-everycell-6","/wiki/HMGB1","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","#cite_note-everycell-6","/wiki/ILF2","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/w/index.php?title=IER2&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/wiki/JUND","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","#cite_note-everycell-6","/wiki/LTBP4","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/wiki/LMO1","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/wiki/MYC","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","#cite_note-everycell-6","/wiki/PAX8","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/wiki/PHF1","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","#cite_note-everycell-6","/wiki/PTTG1IP","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/wiki/SREBF1","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","#cite_note-desperate-7","/wiki/TATA-binding_protein","/wiki/TCEB2","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","#cite_note-everycell-6","/wiki/TCOF1","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/w/index.php?title=Housekeeping_gene&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/wiki/ID3_(gene)","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/wiki/PUF60","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","#cite_note-everycell-6","/wiki/NFKBIA","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","#cite_note-everycell-6","/wiki/RING1","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/w/index.php?title=Housekeeping_gene&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/File:Protein_SNRPB_PDB_1d3b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Protein_SNRPB_PDB_1d3b.png/250px-Protein_SNRPB_PDB_1d3b.png","/wiki/File:Protein_SNRPB_PDB_1d3b.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/ADAR","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/wiki/BAT1","#cite_note-everycell-6","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/wiki/Fibrillarin","/wiki/HNRPD","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","#cite_note-everycell-6","/wiki/HNRPK","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","#cite_note-everycell-6","/wiki/PTBP1","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/wiki/PABPN1","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/wiki/SFRS3","#cite_note-everycell-6","/wiki/SFRS9","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/w/index.php?title=SFNRPA&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","/wiki/SNRPB","#cite_note-housekeeping-1","#cite_note-everycell-6","/w/index.php?t
