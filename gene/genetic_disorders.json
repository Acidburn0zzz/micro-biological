Most\ngenetic disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several\nthousands or millions.\n\nGenetic disorders are heritable, and are passed down from the parents' genes.\nOther defects may be caused by new mutations or changes to the DNA. In such\ncases, the defect will only be heritable if it occurs in the germ line. The same\ndisease, such as some forms of cancer, may be caused by an inherited genetic\ncondition in some people, by new mutations in other people, and by nongenetic\ncauses in still other people.\n\nSome types of recessive gene disorders confer an advantage in certain\nenvironments when only one copy of the gene is present.
