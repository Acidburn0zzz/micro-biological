{"cursor":"4042","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In electrophysiology, the term 'gating' refers to the opening (activation) or\nclosing (by deactivation or inactivation) of ion channels.\n\nWhen ion channels are in a 'closed' (non-conducting) state, they are impermeable\nto ions and do not conduct electrical current. When ion channels are in an open\nstate, they conduct electrical current by allowing some ions to pass through\nthem, and thus across the plasma membrane of the cell. These flows of ions\nacross the membrane result in an electrical current across the membrane. Gating\nis the process of an ion channel transforming between any of its conducting and\nnon-conducting states.\n\nThe name 'gating' derives from the idea that an ion channel protein includes a\npore that is guarded by a gate or several gates, and the gate(s) must be in the\nopen position for any ions to pass through the pore. A variety of cellular\nchanges can trigger gating, depending on the ion channel, including changes in\nvoltage across the cell membrane (voltage-gated ion channels), drugs or hormones\ninteracting with the ion channel (ligand-gated ion channels), changes in\ntemperature,  stretching or deformation of the cell membrane,\naddition of a phosphate group to the ion channel (phosphorylation), and\ninteraction with other molecules in the cell (e.g., G proteins). The\nrate at which any of these gating processes occurs in response to these triggers\nare known as the 'kinetics of gating.' Some drugs and many ion channel toxins\nact as 'gating modifiers' of voltage-gated ion channels by changing the kinetics\nof gating.\n\nThe voltage-gated ion channels of the action potential are often described as\nhaving four gating processes: activation, deactivation, inactivation, and\nreactivation (also called 'recovery from inactivation'). In a model of an ion\nchannel that has two gates (an activation gate and an inactivation gate) that\nmust both be open for ions to be conducted through the channel, 'activation' is\nthe process of opening the activation gate, which occurs in response to the\nvoltage inside the cell membrane (the membrane potential) becoming more positive\nwith respect to the outside of the cell (depolarization); 'deactivation' is the\nopposite process of the activation gate closing in response to the inside of the\nmembrane becoming more negative (repolarization). 'Inactivation' is the closing\nof the inactivation gate; as with activation, inactivation occurs in response to\nthe voltage inside the membrane becoming more positive, but often inactivation\nis found to be delayed in time compared to activation. 'Recovery from\ninactivation' is the opposite of inactivation. Thus, both inactivation and\ndeactivation are processes that lead to the channel becoming non-conducting, but\nthey are different processes in that inactivation is triggered by the inside of\nthe membrane becoming more positive, whereas deactivation is triggered by the\nmembrane potential becoming more negative.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Gating_(electrophysiology)","recorded":1376423783,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Gating_(electrophysiology)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gating_(electrophysiology)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gating_(electrophysiology)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Electrophysiology","/wiki/Activation","/wiki/Ion_channels","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Cell_membrane","/wiki/Cell_(biology)","/wiki/Voltage-gated_ion_channel","/wiki/Ligand-gated_ion_channel","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Phosphate","/wiki/Phosphorylation","/wiki/G_protein","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Kinetics_(physics)","/wiki/Action_potential","/wiki/Membrane_potential","/w/index.php?title=Gating_(electrophysiology)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Gating_(electrophysiology)&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Synaptic_gating","/w/index.php?title=Gating_(electrophysiology)&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Gating_(electrophysiology)&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-8153-1620-8","#cite_ref-2","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10393876","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.96.14.7658","/wiki/PubMed_Central","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33597","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10393876","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-87893-321-2","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gating_(electrophysiology)&oldid=532406948","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Cell_communication","/wiki/Category:Electrophysiology","/wiki/Category:Ion_channels","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gating+%28electrophysiology%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gating+%28electrophysiology%29","/wiki/Gating_(electrophysiology)","/wiki/Talk:Gating_(electrophysiology)","#","/wiki/Gating_(electrophysiology)","/w/index.php?title=Gating_(electrophysiology)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gating_(electrophysiology)&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gating_(electrophysiology)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Gating_(electrophysiology)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Gating_(electrophysiology)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Gating_(electrophysiology)&oldid=532406948","/w/index.php?title=Gating_(electrophysiology)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5527425","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Gating_%28electrophysiology%29&id=532406948","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Gating+%28electrophysiology%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Gating+%28electrophysiology%29&oldid=532406948&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Gating_(electrophysiology)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5527425#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gating_(electrophysiology)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.
