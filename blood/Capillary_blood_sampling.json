Their endothelial linings are only one cell layer thick. These\nmicrovessels, measuring 5-10 Î¼m in diameter, connect arterioles and venules, and\nthey help to enable the exchange of water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and many\nother nutrients and waste chemical substances between blood and the\ntissues {{cite book\n  | last = Maton first = Anthea authorlink = coauthors = Jean Hopkins, Charles\n  | William McLaughlin, Susan Johnson, Maryanna Quon Warner, David LaHart, Jill\n  | D.
