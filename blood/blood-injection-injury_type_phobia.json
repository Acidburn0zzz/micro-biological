In the cases of blood-injection-\ninjury phobias a two-phase vasovagal response is observed: first a brief\nacceleration of heart rate, then its deceleration, bradycardia, and dropped\nblood pressure.  The above may also lead to vasovagal syncope\n(fainting). {{cite web |title = The Merck Manual\n|accessdate = 2007-05-19 |url =\nhttp://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec15/ch196/ch196e.html}}\n\nThese characteristic vasovagal reactions may contribute to the development\nof a phobia.\n\nThe other factors contributing to the development of the blood-injection-injury\nphobias are the same as for other specific phobias.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"blood-injection-injury_type_phobia","recorded":1376428647,"links":[],"instances":["medicine","physiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Phobias"],"headings":["References"],"image":[],"tags":[["injection","medicine"],["stimulus","physiology"]],"members":["injection","stimulus"],"related":["DSM-IV","Mental_disorder","Specific_phobia","Fear_of_blood","Injury_phobia","Injection_(medicine)","Trypanophobia","Medical_procedure","Theodore_Millon","Vasovagal","Stimulus_(physiology)","Heart_rate","Bradycardia","Blood_pressure","Vasovagal_syncope"]}
