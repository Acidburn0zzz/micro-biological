It involves puncturing an artery with a thin needle and syringe and\ndrawing a small volume of blood. The most common puncture site is the radial\nartery at the wrist, but sometimes the femoral artery in the groin or\nother sites are used. The blood can also be drawn from an arterial catheter.\nPulse oximetry plus transcutaneous carbon dioxide measurement is an alternative\nmethod of obtaining similar information as well. An ABG is a test that measures\nthe arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2), carbon dioxide tension\n(PaCO 2), and acidity (pH). In addition, arterial oxyhemoglobin\nsaturation (SaO 2) can be determined. Such information is vital when\ncaring for patients with critical illness or respiratory disease. As a result,\nthe ABG is one of the most common tests performed on patients in intensive care\nunits (ICUs).\n\nThe test is used to determine the pH of the blood, the partial pressure of\ncarbon dioxide and oxygen, and the bicarbonate level. Many blood gas analyzers\nwill also report concentrations of lactate, hemoglobin, several electrolytes,\noxyhemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin. ABG testing is mainly used\nin pulmonology and critical care medicine to determine gas exchange which\nreflect gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary membrane. ABG testing also\nhas a variety of applications in other areas of medicine. Combinations of\ndisorders can be complex and difficult to interpret, so calculators, - Online arterial blood gas analysis nomograms,\nand rules of thumb are commonly used.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"arterial_blood_gas","recorded":1376427888,"links":[],"instances":["physiology","medical","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Respiratory physiology","Blood tests","Respiratory therapy"],"headings":["Sampling and analysis","Parameters and reference ranges","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["mole","unit"],["hypoxia","medical"],["ventilation","physiology"]],"members":["ventilation","hypoxia","mole"],"related":["Blood_test","Blood","Artery","Radial_artery","Wrist","Femoral_artery","Groin","Arterial_catheter","Pulse_oximetry","Arterial_oxygen_tension","Carbon_dioxide_tension","PH","PH","Partial_pressure","Carbon_dioxide","Oxygen","Bicarbonate","Lactic_acid","Hemoglobin","Electrolyte","Oxyhemoglobin","Carboxyhemoglobin","Methemoglobin","Pulmonology","Gas_exchange","Nomograms","Respiratory_therapist","Phlebotomist","Nurse","Radial_artery","Allen's_test","Femoral_artery","Brachial_artery","Heparin","Coagulation","Blood_gas_analyzer","Glucose","Lactic_acid","Hemoglobins","Bilirubin","Electrolyte","PH","Partial_pressure","Reference_ranges","PH","Mole_(unit)","Litre","Oxygen_partial_pressure","KPa","Hypoxia_(medical)","Carbon_dioxide_partial_pressure","Carbon_dioxide","Carbon_dioxide","Ventilation_(physiology)","Carbon_dioxide","Respiratory_acidosis","Hypercapnia","Malignant_hyperthermia","Carbon_dioxide","Respiratory_alkalosis","Hypocapnia","Metabolism","Ketoacidosis","Metabolic_acidosis","Metabolic_alkalosis","Standard_bicarbonate_concentration","Carbon_dioxide","Base_excess","Hemoglobin","Acid-base_homeostasis","Anion_gap","Mechanical_ventilation","Radial_artery_puncture"]}
