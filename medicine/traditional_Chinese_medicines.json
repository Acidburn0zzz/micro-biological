Traditional Chinese Medicine, National Center for Complementary\nand Alternative Medicine, [http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm\nTraditional Chinese Medicine: An Introduction [NCCAM\nBackgrounder]]\n\nThe doctrines of Chinese medicine are rooted in books such as the [[Huangdi\nNeijing|Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon]] and the [[Shanghan lun|Treatise on Cold\nDamage]], as well as in cosmological notions like yin-yang and the five phases.\nStarting in the 1950s, these precepts were modernized in the People's Republic\nof China so as to integrate many anatomical and pathological notions with\nmodern scientific medicine. Nonetheless, some of its methods, including the\nmodel of the body, or concept of disease, are not supported by modern evidence-\nbased medicine.\n\nTCM's view of the body places little emphasis on anatomical structures, but is\nmainly concerned with the identification of functional entities (which regulate\ndigestion, breathing, aging etc.). While health is perceived as harmonious\ninteraction of these entities and the outside world, disease is interpreted as a\ndisharmony in interaction. TCM diagnosis includes in tracing symptoms to\npatterns of an underlying disharmony, by measuring the pulse, inspecting the\ntongue, skin, eyes and by looking at the eating and sleeping habits of the\npatient as well as many other things.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"traditional_Chinese_medicines","recorded":1376428047,"links":[],"instances":["chinese_medicine","chinese_medicine","chinese_medicine","chinese_medicine","chinese_medicine","organs","xue","chinese_medicine","chinese_medicine","chinese_medicine","jinye","pharmacy","chinese_medicine","chinese_medicine","chinese_medicine","chinese_medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Traditional Chinese medicine|","Alternative medical systems","Pharmacy"],"headings":["History","Philosophical background","Model of the body","Concept of disease","Diagnostics","Herbal medicine","Acupuncture and moxibustion","Tui na","Qigong","Other therapies","Relationship with [[evidence based medicine]]","Regulations","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["meridian","chinese_medicine"],["formulary","pharmacy"],["meridian","chinese_medicine"],["traditional_chinese_medicine#zàng-fǔ","organs"],["meridian","chinese_medicine"],["traditional_chinese_medicine#bodily_fluids","jinye"],["heart","chinese_medicine"],["liver","chinese_medicine"],["spleen","chinese_medicine"],["lung","chinese_medicine"],["kidney","chinese_medicine"],["small_intestine","chinese_medicine"],["large_intestine","chinese_medicine"],["gallbladder","chinese_medicine"],["urinary_bladder","chinese_medicine"],["stomach","chinese_medicine"],["meridian","chinese_medicine#twelve_standard_meridians"],["pericardium","chinese_medicine"],["traditional_chinese_medicine#blood","xue"],["meridian","chinese_medicine"]],"members":["gallbladder","urinary_bladder","stomach","kidney","liver","heart","lung","pericardium","formulary","large_intestine","meridian","small_intestine","spleen"],"related":["Tsim_Sha_Tsui","Chinese_herbology","Acupuncture","Tui_na","Qigong","Yinyang","Five_phases","Anatomy","Pathology","Scientific_medicine","TCM_model_of_the_body","Evidence-based_medicine","Ming_Dynasty","Yuan_Dynasty","Shang_dynasty","Oracle","Oracle_bone","Joseph_Needham","Lancing","Bloodletting","Acupuncture_points","Meridian_(Chinese_medicine)","Yellow_Emperor","Natural_environment","Cosmos","Pathology","Diagnosis","Mawangdui","Yinyang","Wu_Xing","Zhang_Zhongjing","Han_Dynasty","Formulary_(pharmacy)","Song_Dynasty","Acupuncture","Huangfu_Mi","Zhang_Zhongjing","Hua_Tuo","Sun_Simiao","Zhang_Jiegu","Li_Shizhen","School_of_Yin_Yang","Wu_xing","Yin_and_yang","Daoism","Zang-fu","Meridian_(Chinese_medicine)","History_of_China","Anatomy","Meridian_(Chinese_medicine)","Blood","Tears","Sputum","Salivary_gland","Gastric_acid","Synovial_fluid","Persperation","Urine","Anatomy","Heart_(Chinese_medicine)","Liver_(Chinese_medicine)","Spleen_(Chinese_medicine)","Lung_(Chinese_medicine)","Kidney_(Chinese_medicine)","Small_intestine_(Chinese_medicine)","Large_Intestine_(Chinese_medicine)","Gallbladder_(Chinese_medicine)","Urinary_Bladder_(Chinese_medicine)","Stomach_(Chinese_medicine)","San_Jiao","Huangdi_Neijing","Wu_xing","Pericardium_(Chinese_medicine)","Tinnitus","Irascibility","Menses","Leukorrhea","Radial_artery","Ginseng","Siraitia_grosvenorii","Plastron","Wormwood","Malaria","Decoction","Rhinoceros_horn","Plastron","Seahorse","Mobula","Manta_ray","Bear_bile","Asiatic_black_bears","Gall_bladder","Materia_medica","Bencao_Gangmu","Excreta","Meridian_(Chinese_medicine)","Stasis","Cochrane_review","Dysmenorrhea","NSAID","Placebo-controlled_study","Acupuncture","Acupuncture_points","Qi","Pain","Moxibustion","Mugwort","Electroacupuncture","World_Health_Organization","Sciatica","Review_article","Cochrane_review","Migraines","Tension_headaches","Osteoarthritis","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Placebo","Tui_na","Acupressure","Shiatsu","Fire_cupping","Suction","Gua_Sha","Bone-setting","Physical_trauma","Taoism","Vitalism","Yin_and_yang","Putative_energy","Pulse_diagnosis","Anatomical","Histological","Dry_needling","Scientific_method","Surgery","Placebo_effect","Manual_therapy","Anatomical","Histological","Mugwort","Vital_energy","Energy","Crude_medicine","Ginseng","Pharmacognosy","Encyclopedia_of_Pseudoscience","Alabama","Kansas","North_Dakota","South_Dakota","Oklahoma","Wyoming","California","Alternative_medicine","Ayurveda","Capsicum_plaster","Chinese_classic_herbal_formula","Chinese_food_therapy","Chinese_herbology","Guizhentang_Pharmaceutical_company","List_of_branches_of_alternative_medicine","List_of_topics_characterized_as_pseudoscience","List_of_traditional_Chinese_medicines","Medicinal_mushrooms","Pharmacognosy","Public_health_in_the_People's_Republic_of_China","Traditional_Korean_medicine","Traditional_Mongolian_medicine","Traditional_Tibetan_medicine","Turtle_farm","HIV/AIDS_and_traditional_Chinese_medicine","Qingdai","Snake_farm","Stephen_T._Chang","Nathan_Sivin"]}
