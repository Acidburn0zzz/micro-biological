{"cursor":"9077","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn the '[[heart]]', a 'ventricle' is one of two large chambers that collect and\nexpel blood received from an atrium towards the peripheral beds within the body\nand lungs. The atrium (an adjacent/upper heart chamber that is smaller than a\nventricle) primes the Pump. 'Interventricular' means between two or more\nventricles (for example the interventricular septum), while 'intraventricular'\nmeans within one ventricle (for example an intraventricular block).\n\nIn a four-chambered heart, such as that in humans, there are two ventricles:\nthe '[[right ventricle]]' pumps blood into the pulmonary circulation to/for\nthe lungs, and the '[[left ventricle]]' pumps blood into the systemic\ncirculation through the aorta (systemic circulation). (See Double circulatory\nsystem for details.)\n\nVentricles have thicker walls than atria and generate higher blood pressures.\nThe physiologic load on the ventricles requiring pumping of blood throughout the\nbody and lungs is much greater than the pressure generated by the atria to fill\nthe ventricles. Further, the left ventricle has thicker walls than the right\nbecause it needs to pump blood to most of the body while the right ventricle\nfills only the lungs. \n\nThe mass of the left ventricle, as estimated by magnetic resonance imaging,\naverages 143 g Â± 38.4 g, with a range of 87Ââ224 g.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Ventricle_(heart)","recorded":1376428728,"links":[],"instances":["medicine","mathematics","anatomy","heart"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cardiac anatomy"],"headings":["In systole and diastole","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["atrium","heart"],["systole","medicine"],["lumen","anatomy"],["systole","medicine"],["fraction","mathematics"],["lumen","anatomy"],["atrium","heart"]],"members":["systole","fraction","lumen","atrium"],"related":["Blood","Atrium_(heart)","Pump","Interventricular_septum","Intraventricular_block","Human","Pulmonary_circulation","Lung","Systemic_circulation","Aorta","Double_circulatory_system","Blood_pressure","Magnetic_resonance_imaging","Systole_(medicine)","Diastole","Cardiology","End-diastolic_volume","End-systolic_volume","Stroke_volume","Ejection_fraction","Cardiac_cycle","One-dimensional","M-Mode_echocardiography","Sonomicrometry","Longitudinal_plane","Diastole","Lumen_(anatomy)","Systole_(medicine)","Diastole","Interventricular_septum","Fraction_(mathematics)","Lumen_(anatomy)","Anatomical_plane","Atrium_(heart)"]}
