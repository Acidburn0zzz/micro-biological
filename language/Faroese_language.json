(in Faroese: fÃ¸royskt, pronounced ) is an Insular\nNordic language spoken as a native language by about 66,000 people, 45,000 of\nwhich reside on the Faroe Islands and 21,000 in other areas, mainly Denmark. It\nis one of four languages descended from the Old West Norse language spoken in\nthe Middle Ages, the others being Icelandic, Norwegian and the extinct Norn,\nwhich is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Faroese and\nIcelandic, its closest extant relative, are not mutually intelligible in speech,\nbut the written languages resemble each other quite closely, largely owing to\nFaroese's etymological\northography.
