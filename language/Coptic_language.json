Coptic Encyclopedia;\nhttp://cdm15831.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/cce/id/520 Egyptian\nbegan to be written using the Greek alphabet in the 1st century. The\nnew writing system became the Coptic script, an adapted Greek alphabet with the\naddition of six or seven signs from the demotic script to represent Egyptian\nsounds the Greek language did not have. Several distinct Coptic dialects are\nidentified, the most prominent of which are 'Sahidic' and 'Bohairic'.\n\nCoptic and Demotic Egyptian are grammatically closely akin to Late Egyptian,\nwhich was written in the Hieroglyphic script. Coptic flourished as a literary\nlanguage from the 2nd to 13th centuries, and its Bohairic dialect continues to\nbe the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. It was\nsupplanted by Egyptian Arabic as a spoken language toward the early modern\nperiod, though revitalization efforts have been underway since the 19th century.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Coptic_language","recorded":1376429158,"links":[],"instances":["letter","diacritic","annotation","egyptologist","linguistics","egyptian","disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Egyptian
