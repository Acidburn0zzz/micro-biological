{"cursor":"13200","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThis article discusses '[[social inequality]] [[income inequality in the United\nStates|in the United States]] and its effects on individual health', and more\nspecifically likelihood of developing diseases.\n\nWhile rates of incidence for many diseases vary based on biological factors\nand inheritable characteristics, a larger disparity, which cannot be explained\nby biological factors, exists in disease rates among varying racial and\nsocioeconomic groups in the United States (for example, lower-income African-\nAmericans and upper-class Caucasians). This suggests that social and economic\nfactors play a role in determining who acquires certain diseases in the United\nStates. For example, heart disease is the most dangerous disease in America,\nfollowed closely by cancer, with the fifth most deadly being diabetes. The\ngeneral risk factors associated with these three diseases include obesity and\npoor diet, tobacco and alcohol use, physical inactivity, and access to medical\ncare and health information. While some of these risk factors are individual\nhealth choices, all of them are also correlated with socioeconomic factors,\nsuch as gender, race, income, environment, and education, and consequently, a\npersonâs likelihood for developing heart disease, cancer, or diabetes is in\npart correlated with these social factors. Men are more likely than women to\ndie from heart disease. Likewise, African-Americans and other racial\nminorities have higher mortality rates from heart disease, cancer, and\ndiabetes than their white counterparts. Among all racial groups, individuals\nwho are impoverished or low income, have lower levels of educational\nattainment, and live in lower-income neighborhoods are all more likely to\ndevelop heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.\n","linknr":227,"url":"Inequality_in_disease","recorded":1376421978,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_in_disease","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:TONE","/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_writing_better_articles","/wiki/Social_inequality","/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Disease","/wiki/Incidence_rate","/wiki/Health_disparities","/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States","/wiki/African-Americans","/wiki/American_upper_class","/wiki/Caucasian_race","/wiki/Heart_disease","/wiki/Cancer","/wiki/Diabetes","/wiki/Risk_factors","/wiki/Obesity","/wiki/Nutrition","/wiki/Tobacco","/wiki/Alcohol","/wiki/Physical_inactivity","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_in_disease#endnote_women","/wiki/Gender","/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)","/wiki/Income","/wiki/Environment_(systems)","/wiki/Education","/wiki/Minorities_in_the_united_states","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_in_disease#endnote_cort","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_in_disease#endnote_african","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_in_disease#endnote_diabetes","/wiki/Poverty","/wiki/Low_income","#endnote_corta","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_in_disease#endnote_hispanics","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_in_disease#endnote_social","#endnote_cortb","#Gender","#Race","#Income","#Environment","#Education","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_in_disease#endnote_men","/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_in_disease#endnote_lung","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_in_disease#endnote_mortality","/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#endnote_cortc","#endnote_africana","#endnote_africanb","#endnote_africanc","#endnote_diabetesa","/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&veaction=edit&section=3","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_in_disease#endnote_income","/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify","#endnote_incomea","#endnote_incomeb","#endnote_incomec","#endnote_africand","#endnote_sociala","#endnote_socialb","/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&veaction=edit&section=4","#endnote_cortd","/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify","#endnote_corte","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_in_disease#endnote_occupation","#endnote_socialc","/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&veaction=edit&section=5","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_in_disease#endnote_region","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_in_disease#endnote_highschool","#endnote_cortf","/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&veaction=edit&section=6","/wiki/Health_and_Social_Class","/wiki/Social_determinants_of_health","/wiki/Social_determinants_of_health_in_poverty","/wiki/Social_determinants_of_obesity","/wiki/Social_epidemiology","/wiki/Unnatural_Causes:_Is_Inequality_Making_Us_Sick%3F","/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis","/wiki/Diseases_of_affluence","/wiki/Diseases_of_poverty","/wiki/Public_health","/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&action=edit&section=7","/w/index.php?title=Inequality_in_disease&veaction=edit&section=7","#ref_women","http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4786","#ref_cort","#ref_cort","#ref_cort","#ref_cort","#ref_cort","#ref_cort","#ref_cort","http://clearinghouse.missouriwestern.edu/manuscripts/175.asp",
