It is therefore a critical\nconcept for evolutionary medicine.\n\nIn addition to sexually transmitted infections, horizontal transmission modes\ninclude, but are not limited to, anterior station and posterior station. In\nanterior station, transmission occurs via the bite of an infected organism, like\nin malaria, dengue fever, and bubonic plague. Posterior station is transmission\nvia contact with infected feces. Examples are rickettsiae driven diseases (like\ntyphus), which are contracted by a body louse's fecal material being scratched\ninto the bloodstream.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Horizontal_disease_transmission","recorded":1376428984,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Infectious diseases"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Infectious_agent","Bacterial","Fungal","Virus","Infection","Evolution","Optimal_virulence","Evolutionary_medicine","Malaria","Dengue_fever","Bubonic_plague","Rickettsiae","Typhus","Vertical_transmission","Optimal_virulence"]}
