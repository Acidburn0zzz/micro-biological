Some STIs can also be\ntransmitted via the use of IV drug needles after its use by an infected person,\nas well as through childbirth or breastfeeding. Sexually transmitted infections\nhave been well known for hundreds of years, and venereology is the branch of\nmedicine that studies these diseases.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Sexually_Transmitted_Disease","recorded":1376428995,"links":[],"instances":["1924","mythology","epidemiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Human sexuality","Sexually
