That is, taxonomy\n# in the traditional sense of the word: rank-based scientific classification.\n# This term is especially used as opposed to cladistic systematics, which groups\n# organisms into clades. It is attributed to Linnaeus, although he neither\n# invented the concept of ranked classification (it goes back to Plato and\n# Aristotle) nor gave it its present form. In fact, it does not have an exact\n# present form, as \"Linnaean taxonomy\" as such does not really exist: it is a\n# collective (abstracting) term for what actually are several separate fields,\n# which use similar approaches.\n\n'Linnaean name' also has two meanings: depending on the context, it may either\nrefer to a formal name given by Linnaeus (personally), such as ''Giraffa\ncamelopardalis'' Linnaeus, 1758, or a formal name in the accepted nomenclature\n(as opposed to a modernistic clade name).\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Linnaean_system","recorded":1376428690,"links":[],"instances":["botany","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Carl Linnaeus|Taxonomy","Scientific classification","Classification systems","Biological nomenclature","Botanical nomenclature","Zoological nomenclature"],"headings":["The taxonomy of Linnaeus","Rank-based scientific classification","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["taxonomy","biology"],["ovary","plants#half-inferior_ovary"],["receptacle","botany"],["kingdom","biology"]],"members":["receptacle","ovary","kingdom","taxonomy"],"related":["Biological_classification","Carl_Linnaeus","Taxonomy_(biology)","Scientific_classification","Cladistics","Clade","Plato","Aristotle","Giraffa_camelopardalis","Clade","Animal,_vegetable_or_mineral","Biological_nomenclature","Nomenclature_codes","Mammalia_in_the_10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae","Aves_in_the_10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae","Amphibia_in_the_10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae","Pisces_in_the_10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae","Insecta_in_the_10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae","Vermes_in_the_10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae","Ordo_naturalis","Stamen","Pistil","Receptacle_(botany)","Monoecious","Dioecious","Fern","Fungus","Algae","Bryophyte","Mineral","Binomial_nomenclature","Genus","Species","Human","Binomen","Scholasticism","Organism","Systematics","Nomenclature_code","Taxonomic_rank","Hierarchy","Kingdom_(biology)","Animal","Plant","Fungi","International_Code_of_Botanical_Nomenclature","Cladistics","Phylogenetic_nomenclature","Clade","Evolution","Phylogeny","Evolutionary_taxonomy","Extant_taxon","Extinction","Cladistics","Willi_Hennig","Polyphyly","Monophyly","Paraphyly","Plant","Animal","Minerals","Monera","Prokaryote","Protist","Fungus","Phylogenetics","Bacterium","Archaea","Eukaryote","Genome","Cladistic","Molecular_phylogenetic","PhyloCode","History_of_plant_systematics","Phylogenetic_tree","Zoology_mnemonic","Richard_Dawkins","Stephen_Jay_Gould"]}
