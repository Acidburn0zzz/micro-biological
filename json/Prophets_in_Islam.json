{"cursor":"62645","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nMuslims identify the 'prophets of Islam' () as those humans who were assigned a\nspecial mission by God to guide humans. Muslims believe that every prophet was\ngiven a belief to worship God and their respective followers believed it as\nwell. Each prophet, in Muslim belief, preached the same main belief,\nThe Oneness of the Divine Creator, worshiping of that One God, avoidance of\nidolatry and sin, and the belief in the Day of Resurrection. Each came to preach\nIslam at different times in history and some told of the coming of the final\nprophet and messenger of God, who would be named \"Ahmad\" commonly known as\nMuhammad. Each prophet directed a message to a different group of people, and\nthus would preach Islam in accordance with the times.\n\nMessengers are prophets whom have been ordered to convey and propagate what God\nrevealed to them. To believe in the Messengers means to believe that God has\nsent them to creation to guide them, and perfect their life, and their\nhereafter, and He has aided them with miracles which demonstrate their\ntruthfulness; and that they have conveyed the message of God; and have revealed\nwhat they were ordered to reveal to the responsible and accountable individuals;\nand it is obligatory to respect all of them, and not to discriminate or\ndifferentiate between any of them, and they are infallible from minor sins and\nenormities. Shaatri, A. I. (2007). Nayl al Rajaa'\nbisharh' Safinat an'najaa'. Dar Al Minhaj.\n\nIslamic tradition holds that God sent messengers to every nation.\nMuslims believe that God finally sent Muhammad to transmit the message of the\nQuran, the holy book which, according to Islam, is universal in its message. The\nreason the Muslims believe the Quran is universal and will remain uncorrupted is\nbecause they believe that previous Islamic holy books, namely the Torah given to\nMoses, the Psalms given to David, and the Gospel given to Jesus, were for a\nparticular time and community and because they believe that, even if the books\nwere corrupted, many prophets were still to come who could tell the people of\nwhat was correct in the scripture and warn them of corruptions. Muhammad\ntherefore, being the last prophet, was vouchsafed a book which, in Muslim\nbelief, will remain in its true form till the Last Day.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Prophets_in_Islam","recorded":1376427643,"links":[],"instances":["sura","united_monarchy","biblical_person","ancestor_of_noah","prophet","letter","bible","son_of_jacob","islam","theologian","islam","islam","son_of_judah","letter","biblical_figure","biblical_figure","islam","sura","mother_of_jesus"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Prophets
