It is a\ngroup of cells positioned on the wall of the right atrium, near the entrance of\nthe superior vena cava. These cells are specialized cardiomyocytes. Though they\npossess some contractile filaments, they do not contract robustly.\n\nThe SAN was first described in 1907 by Arthur Keith and Martin Flack.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"sinoatrial","recorded":1376428692,"links":[],"instances":["biology","heart","heart","cardiac"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cardiac anatomy"],"headings":["Role as a pacemaker","Histology","Innervation","Blood supply","Sinus node dysfunction","Additional images","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["refractory_period","cardiac"],["atrium","heart"],["ventricle","heart"],["tissue","biology"]],"members":["tissue","ventricle","atrium","refractory_period"],"related":["Micrograph","Sinuatrial_nodal_artery","Right_coronary_artery","Cardiac_myocytes","Right_atrium","H&E_stain","Sinuatrial_nodal_artery","Right_atrium","Heart","Sinus_rhythm","Superior_vena_cava","Cardiomyocytes","Arthur_Keith","Martin_Flack","Electrical_impulse","Action_potential","Pacemaker_potential","Muscle_cell","Refractory_period_(cardiac)","Neural","Hormonal","Action_potentials","Parasympathetic_nervous_system","Beats_per_minute","Atrioventricular_node","AV_node","Atrium_(heart)","Ventricle_(heart)","Atrial_septum","Purkinje_fibers","Tissue_(biology)","Nerve_fibre","H&E_stain","Superior_vena_cava","Right_atrium","Parasympathetic_nervous_system","Vagus_Nerve","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Spinal_nerve","Autonomic_nervous_system","Right_coronary_artery","Myocardial_infarction","Ischaemia","Anastomosis","Mount_Sinai_Hospital,_New_York","Cardiology","Cardiac_pacemaker","Electrical_conduction_system_of_the_heart","Heart_block","Sinus_bradycardia","Sinus_tachycardia"]}
