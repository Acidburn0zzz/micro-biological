He is an Associate Professor in the Department of\nBiological Engineering] at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His\nresearch interests focus on the reprogramming of bacterial organisms to perform\ncoordinated, complex tasks for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. He is\na member of the National Science Foundation-funded Synthetic Biology Engineering\nResearch Center, called SynBERC, and works in the developing field of synthetic\nbiology. His recent works include:\n\n* Engineering a bacterial two-component system to regulate gene expression in\n  response to red light.\n\n* Engineering bacteria to sense its environment and conditionally invade cancer\n  cells either when the concentration of bacteria is large enough, when the\n  environment has little oxygen (e.g., inside a tumor), or when a specific\n  chemical is present.\n\n* Constructing a logical AND gate inside bacteria.\n\nCurrent research projects use these new environmental sensors and logical\nswitches to control the assembly and function of newly redesigned systems, such\nas a secretion needle that exports spider silk proteins or a photosynthetic\napparatus responsible for converting light into chemical energy.\n\nIn 2006, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35\ninnovators in the world under the age of 35. He is currently Editor-in-\nChief of [http://pubs.acs.org/journal/asbcd6 ACS Synthetic Biology].\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Christopher_Voigt","recorded":1376428649,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Synthetic biology","TR35 winners"],"headings":["External links","References"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Ann_Arbor,_Michigan","United_States","United_States","Synthetic_Biology","University_of_California,_San_Francisco","MIT","University_of_Michigan","Caltech","UC_Berkeley","Zhen-Gang_Wang","Frances_Arnold","Stephen_Mayo","Adam_P_Arkin","Biophysicist","Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","Pharmaceutical","Synthetic_biology","Two-component_system","Gene_expression","Red_light","Cancer","Bacteria","Oxygen","Tumor","AND_gate","Sensor","Logical_switches","Silk","Photosynthetic","Light","Chemical_energy","Technology_Review","TR35","Ann_Arbor,_Michigan"]}
