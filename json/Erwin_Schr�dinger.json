SchrÃ¶dinger\nproposed an original interpretation of the physical meaning of the wave\nfunction and in subsequent years repeatedly criticized the conventional\nCopenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics (using e.g. the paradox of\nSchrÃ¶dinger's cat). In addition, he was the author of many works in various\nfields of physics: statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, physics of\ndielectrics, color theory, electrodynamics, general relativity, and cosmology,\nand he made several attempts to construct a unified field theory. In his book\n[[What Is Life?]] SchrÃ¶dinger addressed the problems of genetics, looking at\nthe phenomenon of life from the point of view of physics. He paid great\nattention to the philosophical aspects of science, ancient and oriental\nphilosophical concepts, ethics and religion. He also\nwrote on philosophy and theoretical biology.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Erwin_Schrödinger","recorded":1376418417,"links":[],"instances":["moon","crater"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1887 births","1961 deaths","People from Landstraße","Austrian atheists","Austrian emigrants to Ireland","Austrian Nobel laureates","Austrian people of British descent","Austrian physicists","Color scientists","Corresponding Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences","Deaths from tuberculosis","Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford","Foreign Members of the Royal Society","Honorary Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences","Humboldt University of Berlin faculty","Infectious disease deaths in Austria","Irish physicists","Members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences","Mystics","Nobel laureates in Physics","Optical physicists","People associated with the University of Zurich","People who emigrated to escape Nazism","Quantum physicists","Recipients of the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art","Recipients of the Pour le Mérite (civil class)","Theoretical physicists","Thermodynamicists","University of Breslau faculty","University of Graz faculty","University of Stuttgart faculty","University of Vienna faculty","Winners of the Max Planck Medal"],"headings":["Biography","Scientific activites","Legacy","Honors and awards","Bibliography","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["schrödinger","crater"],["far_side","moon"]],"members":["far_side","schrödinger"],"related":["Vienna","Austria-Hungary","Austria","Republic_of_Ireland","Physics","University_of_Breslau","University_of_Zürich","Humboldt_University_of_Berlin","University_of_Oxford","University_of_Graz","Dublin_Institute_for_Advanced_Studies","Ghent_University","University_of_Vienna","Friedrich_Hasenöhrl","Franz_S._Exner","Friedrich_Hasenöhrl","Linus_Pauling","Felix_Bloch","Brendan_Scaife","Schrödinger's_cat","Schrödinger_method","Schrödinger_functional","Schrödinger_group","Schrödinger_picture","Schrödinger-Newton_equations","Schrödinger_field","Schrödinger_logic","Cat_state","Max_Planck_Medal","Austrians","Physicist","Quantum_field_theory","Schrödinger_equation","Matrix_mechanics","Copenhagen_interpretation","Schrödinger's_cat","Statistical_mechanics","Thermodynamics","Color_theory","Electrodynamics","General_relativity","Cosmology","Vienna_University_of_Technology","Pantheism","God","Franz_S._Exner","Friedrich_Hasenöhrl","Arthur_Schopenhauer","Habilitation","Gorizia","Duino","Sistiana","Max_Wien","Jena","Stuttgart","Breslau_University","University_of_Zurich","Max_Planck","Humboldt_University_of_Berlin","University_of_Oxford","Paul_Dirac","Princeton_University","University_of_Edinburgh","Albert_Einstein","Schrödinger's_cat","Thought_experiment","Anschluss","Nazism","Albert_Einstein","Italy","University_of_Oxford","Ghent_University","Ireland","Taoiseach","Éamon_de_Valera","Dublin_Institute_for_Advanced_Studies","Dublin","Clontarf,_Dublin","Classical_unified_field_theories","Negentropy","Molecule","Organism","James_D._Watson","Gene","DNA","Double_helix","Francis_Crick","H.J._Muller","Vedanta","Hinduism","Consciousness","Universe","The_King's_Hospital","Wave–particle_duality","Tuberculosis","Sanatorium","Arosa","Vienna","Alpbach","Max_Planck","Albert_Einstein","Niels_Bohr","Arnold_Sommerfeld","Hermann_Weyl","Eigenvalue","Schrödinger_equation","Quantum_harmonic_oscillator","Rigid_rotor","Diatomic_molecule","Werner_Heisenberg","Color","Color_perception","Colorimetry","Schrödinger's_cat","Schrödinger's_equation","Schrödinger_(crater)","Far_side_(Moon)","Erwin_Schrödinger_International_Institute_for_Mathematical_Physics","Nobel_Prize_for_Physics","Schrödinger_equation","Max_Planck_Medal","Erwin_Schrödinger_Prize","Austrian_Academy_of_Sciences","Austrian_Decoration_for_Science_and_Art","Allen_&_Unwin","James_Vincent_Murphy","Ernest_Rutherford","Entropy_and_life","List_of_Austrian_scientists","List_of_Austrians","Subject-object_problem","John_Gribbin","Nobel_Lecture","Physics","Vedanta","WATOC","Physicist","Erdberg,_Vienna","Vienna","Vienna"]}
