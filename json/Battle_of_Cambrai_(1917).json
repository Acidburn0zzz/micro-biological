Cambrai, in the ''Nord dÃ©partement'' (Nord-Pas-de-\nCalais), was a key supply point for the German Siegfried Stellung (part of the\nHindenburg Line) and the nearby Bourlon Ridge would be an excellent gain from\nwhich to threaten the rear of the German line to the north. The operation was to\ninclude an experimental artillery action. Major General Tudor, Commander Royal\nArtillery (CRA) of the 9th Division, suggested trying out new artillery-infantry\ntechniques on his sector of the front. During preparations, J. F. C. Fuller, a\nstaff officer with the Royal Tank Corps (RTC), was in the process of looking for\na place to use tanks as raiding parties. General Julian Byng, commander of the\nBritish Third Army, decided to incorporate them into the attack.\n\nThe battle is often erroneously noted for being the first mass use of tanks in a\ncombined arms operation. However, the French had deployed large numbers of tanks\nin and 1917, and the British more than Flanders in June and July. Despite the\ninitial success of the Mark IV tanks at Cambrai, German artillery and infantry\ndefences exposed the frailties of their armour and the vehicles became mostly\nineffective after the first day. The battle was largely an artillery-infantry\nengagement that achieved, surprise and technical superiority against strong\nfortifications but weak German infantry and artillery defences, which were\nquickly reinforced. The British attack demonstrated that the Hindenburg Line\ncould be penetrated and showed the value of new artillery and infantry methods,\nsuch as sound ranging and infiltration tactics that would later play a vital\npart during the Hundred Days Offensive.\n\nThe popular perception of the battle as a tank battle was largely from writing\nby Basil Liddell Hart and J. F. C. Fuller, the latter erroneously claimed credit\nfor the plan. Liddell Hart, whose position as Military Correspondent of the\n[[Daily Telegraph]] and [[The Times]] newspapers gave him great public\ninfluence, was a critic of Douglas Haig and attempted to use the battle to\nindicate a \"new\" form of doctrine. Several modern studies have rejected their\nversion of events and returned to a view nearer to that of the [[History of the\nGreat War|British Official History]].\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Battle_of_Cambrai_(1917)","recorded":1376429220,"links":[],"instances":["united_kingdom","united_kingdom","british_army_officer","united_kingdom","2nd_west_riding_division","united_kingdom","united_kingdom","scottish_division","united_kingdom","eastern_division","world_war_i","ulster_division","light_division","united_kingdom","département","highland_division"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Conflicts in 1917","1917 in France|Battle of Cambrai","Battles of the Western Front (World War I)","History of Nord (French department)|Battle of Cambrai (1917)","Tank battles","Battles of World War I involving Newfoundland","Battles of World War I involving the United Kingdom","Battles of World War I involving the United States","Battles of World War I involving Germany","Battle honours of the Rifle Brigade","Battle honours of the King's Royal Rifle Corps"],"headings":["Prelude","Battle","Aftermath","Commemoration","Notes","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["western_front","world_war_i"],["nord","département"],["9th","scottish_division"],["third_army","united_kingdom"],["9th","scottish_division"],["iii_corps","united_kingdom"],["iv_corps","united_kingdom"],["british_12th","eastern_division"],["british_20th","light_division"],["6th_infantry_division","united_kingdom"],["british_51st","highland_division","world_war_i"],["british_62nd","2nd_west_riding_division"],["british_36th","ulster_division"],["40th_infantry_division","united_kingdom"],["john_ponsonby","british_army_officer"],["vii_corps","united_kingdom"],["guards_division","united_kingdom"]],"members":["guards_division","iii_corps","john_ponsonby","40th_infantry_division","british_62nd","vii_corps","6th_infantry_division","9th","third_army","british_12th","western_front","british_36th","british_20th","iv_corps","nord","british_51st"],"related":["Mark_IV_tank","Western_Front_(World_War_I)","World_War_I","Cambrai","Julian_Byng,_1st_Viscount_Byng_of_Vimy","Georg_von_der_Marwitz","World_War_I","Cambrai","Nord_(département)","German_Empire","Hindenburg_Line","Major_General","Henry_Hugh_Tudor","Commander,_Royal_Artillery","9th_(Scottish)_Division","J._F._C._Fuller","Royal_Tank_Corps","General","Julian_Byng","Third_Army_(United_Kingdom)","Tank","Combined_arms","Mark_IV_tank","Hundred_Days_Offensive","Basil_Liddell_Hart","Douglas_Haig","Henry_Hugh_Tudor","9th_(Scottish)_Division","No._106_Fuze","III_Corps_(United_Kingdom)","William_Pulteney_Pulteney","IV_Corps_(United_Kingdom)","British_12th_(Eastern)_Division","British_20th_(Light)_Division","Canal_de_Saint-Quentin","Masnières","6th_Infantry_Division_(United_Kingdom)","British_51st_(Highland)_Division_(World_War_I)","George_Montague_Harper","British_62nd_(2nd_West_Riding)_Division","British_36th_(Ulster)_Division","Battle_of_Passchendaele","40th_Infantry_Division_(United_Kingdom)","John_Ponsonby_(British_Army_officer)","Thomas_D'Oyly_Snow","VII_Corps_(United_Kingdom)","British_29th_Division","Guards_Division_(United_Kingdom)","Cambrai","Stormtrooper","Royal_Newfoundland_Regiment","Masnières_Newfoundland_Memorial"]}
