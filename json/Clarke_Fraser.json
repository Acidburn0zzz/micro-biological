Spanning the fields of science and\nmedicine, he was Canada's first medical geneticist, one of the creators of the\ndiscipline of medical genetics in North America, and laid the foundations in the\nfield of Genetic Counselling, which has enhanced the lives of patients\nworldwide. Among his many accomplishments, Dr. Fraser pioneered work in the\ngenetics of cleft palate and popularized the concept of multifactorial disease.\nDr. Fraser is an iconic figure in Canadian medicine, as well as a biomedical\npioneer, a fine teacher, and an outstanding scientist.\n\nBorn in Norwich, Connecticut, he returned with his family to Canada when he was\nan infant. After a few years in Dublin where his father, Frank Wise Fraser was\nCanadian Trade Commissioner, the family moved to Jamaica where he received his\nprimary and secondary school education at Munro College. He received a Bachelor\nof Science degree in 1940 from Acadia University, a Master of Science degree in\n1941, a Ph.D. in 1945, and a Doctor of Medicine degree in 1950 from McGill\nUniversity. During World War II, he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force but\ndid not go overseas.\n\nBefore Dr. Fraser took the stage, genetics and medicine were two very separate\nfields. There was no vision for the potential of genetics in human medicine. But\nvery soon, Dr. Fraser turned his attention from fruit flies and mice to human\ngenetics, and became the founder of the first Canadian medical genetics\ndepartment in a paediatric hospital, aptly named the F. Clarke Fraser Clinical\nGenetics Centre at McGill University in 1995.\n\n* 1950: joined McGill University as an Assistant Professor of Genetics.\n* 1955: appointed an Associate and in 1960 was made a full professor.\n* 1970-82 was the Molson Professor of Genetics in the Department of Biology.\n* 1973-82, was also a Professor of Paediatrics.\n* 1979-82, Professor in the McGill Centre for Human Genetics.\n* 1979 Founding co-director of the Medical Research Council of Canada Group in\n  Medical Genetics, the longest lasting group in the history of the MRC.\n* 1952-82 Founder and Director of the Department of Medical Genetics at the\n  Montreal Children's Hospital.\n* 1982-85, Professor of Clinical Genetics at Memorial University of\n  Newfoundland.\n* 1990-93, Director of the Genetics Working Group of the Royal Commission on New\n  Reproductive Technologies.\n\nDr. Fraser has served as president of the major North American societies in\nGenetics and Teratology and has won almost every award in his field.\n* 1966 Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.\n* 1984 Officer of the Order of Canada.\n* 1999 Government of Quebec's Prix Wilder-Penfield, awarded for achievement in\n  the biomedical sciences.\n* 2012 Elected to the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. He has been awarded four\n  honorary doctorates, from Acadia University (1967), SUNY at Potsdam, Dalhousie\n  University (2003) and McGill University (2010).\n\nFraser made contributions in three areas. He collected data on recurrence risks\nfor a number of pediatric conditions, to answer the questions of the parents of\naffected children. He helped develop the principles of genetic counseling. He\nshowed that cortisone, injected into pregnant mice, caused cleft palates in the\noffspring, and that the frequency of induced clefts varied with the genotype,\nthus bringing genetics into teratology. From this he developed the\nmultifactorial threshold model that underlies many common familial conditions.\n\nBut Dr. Fraserâs contributions reached far beyond the lab to the very lives of\npatients everywhere. His gentle, compassionate approach was much appreciated by\nhis patients and he passed this warmth and understanding onto a succession of\ngraduate students, physicians and genetic counsellors in both Canada and the\nUnited States. Ever contributing in a myriad of ways, Dr. Fraserâs classroom\ntechniques were renowned among students and he coauthored several textbooks,\nmany still used today.\n","linknr":213,"url":"Clarke_Fraser","recorded":1376425860,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Clarke_Fraser&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Clarke_Fraser&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke_Fraser","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Order_of_Canada","/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_Canada","/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Canada","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Geneticist","/wiki/Norwich,_Connecticut","/wiki/Munro_College","/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science","/wiki/Acadia_University","/wiki/Master_of_Science","/wiki/Ph.D.","/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine","/wiki/McGill_University","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Air_Force","/wiki/Montreal_Children%27s_Hospital","/wiki/Memorial_University_of_Newfoundland","/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Canada","/wiki/Order_of_Canada","/wiki/Prix_Wilder-Penfield","/wiki/Canadian_Medical_Hall_of_Fame","/w/index.php?title=Clarke_Fraser&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Clarke_Fraser&veaction=edit&section=1","http://utpress.utpress.utoronto.ca/cgi-bin/cw2w3.cgi?p=fowlis&t=68546&d=4142","http://www.reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3207/prix.html","http://www.cdnmedhall.org/2012-inductees-named-hall-fame","/w/index.php?title=Clarke_Fraser&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Clarke_Fraser&veaction=edit&section=2","http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0003036","/wiki/The_Canadian_Encyclopedia","/wiki/Template:Canadian_Medical_Hall_of_Fame","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Canadian_Medical_Hall_of_Fame&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Canadian_Medical_Hall_of_Fame&action=edit","/wiki/Canadian_Medical_Hall_of_Fame","/wiki/Terry_Fox","/wiki/John_James_Rickard_Macleod","/wiki/Armand_Frappier","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Macklem&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=John_Dirks&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/F._Clarke_Fraser","/wiki/Lap-Chee_Tsui","/wiki/Albert_Aguayo","/w/index.php?title=John_Bienenstock&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Paul_David","/wiki/Jonathan_Campbell_Meakins","/wiki/Allan_Ronald","/w/index.php?title=D._Lorne_Tyrrell&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Alan_C._Burton&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/William_Arthur_Cochrane","/wiki/Phil_Gold","/w/index.php?title=James_C._Hogg&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Vera_Peters&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Calvin_Stiller&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Sylvia_Fedoruk","/wiki/Tak_Wah_Mak","/wiki/Ronald_Melzack","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Tator&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Mladen_Vranic&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Elizabeth_Bagshaw","/wiki/Felix_d%27Herelle","/wiki/Jean_Dussault","/wiki/Wilbert_Keon","/wiki/Endel_Tulving","/wiki/David_Hubel","/w/index.php?title=John_McEachern&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Ian_McWhinney","/wiki/Anthony_Pawson","/wiki/Hans_Selye","/wiki/Oswald_Avery","/wiki/John_Gerald_FitzGerald","/wiki/Marc_Lalonde","/wiki/Maurice_LeClair","/wiki/Ernest_McCulloch","/wiki/James_Till","/wiki/William_Feindel","/wiki/Donald_Olding_Hebb","/wiki/Charles_Hollenberg","/wiki/Charles_B._Huggins","/wiki/Fraser_Mustard","/wiki/Marie-Marguerite_d%27Youville","/w/index.php?title=John_Bradley_(physician)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Henry_Friesen","/w/index.php?title=William_Gallie&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Peter_Lougheed","/wiki/Frederick_Montizambert","/wiki/Charles_Scriver","/wiki/Lucille_Teasdale-Corti","/wiki/Bernard_Belleau","/w/index.php?title=G._Malcolm_Brown&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/John_Robert_Evans","/wiki/Jack_Hirsh","/wiki/Lenora_King","/wiki/David_Sackett","/wiki/Murray_Barr","/wiki/Norman_Bethune","/wiki/Roberta_Bondar","/wiki/Tommy_Douglas","/wiki/Ray_Farquharson","/wiki/Charles_Miller_Fisher","/wiki/Claude_Fortier","/wiki/Gustave_Gingras","/wiki/Harold_E._Johns","/wiki/Heinz_Lehmann","/wiki/Maud_Menten","/wiki/Charles_Thomas_Beer","/wiki/Wilfred_Bigelow","/wiki/Henri_Breault","/wiki/Wilfred_Grenfell","/w/index.php?title=Pierre_Masson&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Brenda_Milner","/wiki/Robert_L._Noble","/wiki/Louis_Siminovitch","/wiki/Henry_J_M_Barnett","/wiki/Bruce_Chown","/wiki/He
