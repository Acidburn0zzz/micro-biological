The term 'asepsis' often refers to those practices used to\npromote or induce asepsis in an operative field in surgery or medicine to\nprevent infection. Ideally, a surgical field is \"sterile,\" meaning it is free of\nall biological contaminants, not just those that can cause disease,\nputrefaction, or fermentation, but that is a situation that is difficult to\nattain, especially given the patient is often a source of infectious agents.\nTherefore, there is no current method to safely eliminate all of the patients'\ncontaminants without causing significant tissue damage. However, elimination of\ninfection is the goal of asepsis, not sterility.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Asepsis","recorded":1376428442,"links":[],"instances":["microbiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Surgery","Medical hygiene","Antiseptics"],"headings":["History","Methods","See also","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["sterilization","microbiology"],["sterilization","microbiology"]],"members":["sterilization"],"related":["Bacteria","Virus","Fungi","Parasitism","Surgery","Medicine","Infection","Sterilization_(microbiology)","Ignaz_Semmelweis","Puerperal_fever","Louis_Pasteur","Joseph_Lister,_1st_Baron_Lister","Carbolic_acid","Lawson_Tait","Ernst_von_Bergmann","Autoclave","Hygiene","Air_current","Germicide","Iodine","Betadine","Surgical_suture","Xenograft","Disinfectant","Sterilization_(microbiology)"]}
