After 1890, the\nFederal government, rather than the individual states, regulated immigration\ninto the United States, [http://www.nps.gov/elis/historyculture/index.htm\nEllis Island], National Park Service, United States Department of the\nInterior and the Immigration Act of 1891 established a Commissioner of\nImmigration in the Treasury Department. Over the years, these matters were later\ntransferred to the purview of the United States Department of Commerce and Labor\nafter 1903, the Department of Labor after 1913, and the Department of Justice\nafter 1940.\n\nIn 2003 the administration of immigration services, including permanent\nresidence, naturalization, asylum, and other functions became the responsibility\nof the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS), which existed only\nfor a short time before changing to its current name, U.S. Citizenship and\nImmigration Services (USCIS). The investigative and enforcement functions\n(including investigations, deportation, and intelligence) were combined with INS\nand U.S. Customs investigators, the Federal Protective Service, and the Federal\nAir Marshal Service, to create U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nThe border functions of the INS, which included the Border Patrol along with INS\nInspectors, were combined with U.S. Customs Inspectors into the newly created\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The 2000 documentary [[Well-Founded\nFear]] provided the first and only time a film crew was privy to a behind-the-\nscenes look at the INS asylum process in the U.S.\n","linknr":324,"url":"Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service","recorded":1376419203,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:US-ImmigrationAndNaturalizationService-Seal.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/US-ImmigrationAndNaturalizationService-Seal.svg/160px-US-ImmigrationAndNaturalizationService-Seal.svg.png","/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_United_States_Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Flag_of_the_United_States_Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service.png/160px-Flag_of_the_United_States_Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service.png","#cite_note-1933establishment-1","/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement","/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Washington,_D.C.","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice","http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis","/wiki/File:Oldinsseattle.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Oldinsseattle.jpg/220px-Oldinsseattle.jpg","/wiki/File:Oldinsseattle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","#cite_note-2","/wiki/U.S._Citizenship_and_Immigration_Services","/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement","/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security","/wiki/September_11_attacks","/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify","/wiki/Immigration","/wiki/Naturalization","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_Act_of_1891&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/United_States_Treasury_Department","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce_and_Labor","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice","/wiki/Naturalization","/wiki/Bureau_of_Citizenship_and_Immigration_Services","/wiki/U.S._Citizenship_and_Immigration_Services","/wiki/United_States_Federal_Protective_Service","/wiki/Federal_Air_Marshal_Service","/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement","/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection","/wiki/Well-Founded_Fear","#Mission","#Structure","#History","#In_popular_culture","#See_also","#References","#External_links","#Opinions_and_experiences_with_the_INS","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service&veaction=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service&veaction=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service&veaction=edit&section=3","/wiki/File:INS_1924.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/INS_1924.jpg/220px-INS_1924.jpg","/wiki/File:INS_1924.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/American_Civil_War","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","#cite_note-4","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury","#cite_note-na-5","/wiki/Ellis_Island","/wiki/United_States_Congress","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce","#cite_note-1933establishment-1","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924","/wiki/United_States_Census","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State","/wiki/Visa_(document)","#cite_note-na-5","/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor","#cite_note-na-5","/wiki/Benjamin_Civiletti","#cite_note-.2770s_271-6","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service&action=edit&section=4","/w/inde
