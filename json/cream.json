In un-homogenized milk, the\nfat, which is less dense, will eventually rise to the top. In the industrial\nproduction of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called\n\"separators\". In many countries, cream is sold in several grades depending on\nthe total butterfat content. Cream can be dried to a powder for shipment to\ndistant markets.\n\nCream skimmed from milk may be called \"sweet cream\" to distinguish it from whey\ncream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. Whey cream has a lower\nfat content and tastes more salty, tangy and \"cheesy\".
