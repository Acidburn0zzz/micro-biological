[http://www.biospheres.com/keyallencv.html John Polk Allen's\nCurriculum Vitae] He is best known as the inventor and Director of\nResearch of Biosphere 2, the world's largest laboratory of global ecology, and\nwas the founder of Synergia Ranch. Allen is a proponent of the science of\nbiospherics. Biosphere 2 set a number of world records in closed life system\nwork including, among others, degree of sealing tightness, 100% waste recycle\nand water recycle, and duration of human residence within a closed system (eight\npeople for two years). Allen has also conceived and co-founded nine other\nprojects around the world, pioneering in sustainable co-evolutionary\ndevelopment.\n\nAllen began the first manned Biosphere Test Module experiment in September 1988,\nresiding in the almost fully recyclable closed ecological system environment for\nthree days and setting a world record at that time, proving that closed\necological systems would work with humans inside. As the vice-president of\nBiospheric Development for the project, as well as Executive Chairman, Allen was\nresponsible for the science and engineering that created the materially closed\nlife system, as well as the development of spin-off technologies.\n\nHe is currently the Chairman of Global Ecotechnics Corporation\n(www.globalecotechnics.com). This is an international project development and\nmanagement company with a Biospheric Design Division engaged in designing and\npreparing to build the second generation of advanced materially closed\nbiospheric systems and ecologically enriched biomic systems\n(www.biospheres.com); and an EcoFrontiers Division which owns and operates\ninnovative sustainable ecological projects of which he was the co-founder and\nchief designer in France, Australia (5000 acre savannah regeneration project),\nPuerto Rico (1000 acre sustainable rainforest project) and England\n(www.ecotechnics.edu).\n\nAllen currently serves as Chairman of Global Ecotechnics, and a director of\nBiospheric Design and of Institute of Ecotechnics. He is Fellow of the Royal\nGeographical Society, the Linnean Society, and the Explorers Club.\n\nIn the early 1960s, John Allen worked on regional development projects with\nDavid Lillienthalâs Development Resources Corporation in the U.S., Iran, and\nCÃ´te d'Ivoire where he became an expert in complex regional development. In the\nmid-1960s Allen and a group of associates attempted a solder flux company that\nfailed. Before that he headed a special metals team at Allegheny-Ludlium Steel\nCorporation which developed over thirty alloys to product status. He has led\nexpeditions studying ecology, particularly the ecology of early civilizations:\nNigeria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tibet, Turkey, India, and the\nAltiplano.\n\nHe studied anthropology and history at Northwestern, Stanford, and Oklahoma\nUniversities, and served in the U.S. Armyâs Engineering Corps as a machinist. He\ngraduated from Colorado School of Mines and received an MBA with High\nDistinction from the Harvard Business School. In the early 1960s, Allen headed a\nspecial metals team at Allegheny-Ludlum Steel Corporation which developed over\nthirty alloys to product status, then he worked with David Lillienthalâs\nDevelopment Resources Corporation in the U.S., Iran, and CÃ´te d'Ivoire.\n\nUnder the pen name, 'Johnny Dolphin', he has chronicled his personal history\nalongside the social history of his many destinations in novels, poetry, short\nstories and plays.\n","linknr":123,"url":"John_P._Allen","recorded":1376421476,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_P._Allen&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_P._Allen&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_P._Allen","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:John_P._Allen.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/John_P._Allen.jpg/220px-John_P._Allen.jpg","/wiki/File:John_P._Allen.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Carnegie,_Oklahoma","/wiki/Oklahoma","#cite_note-who-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Biosphere_2","/wiki/Synergia_Ranch","/wiki/Biospherics","/w/index.php?title=Global_Ecotechnics&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Royal_Geographical_Society","/wiki/Linnean_Society","/wiki/Explorers_Club","/wiki/Harvard_Business_School","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=John_P._Allen&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=John_P._Allen&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-who_1-0","/wiki/Marquis_Who%27s_Who","/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#accessdate_missing_url","#cite_ref-2","http://www.biospheres.com/keyallencv.html","#cite_ref-3","http://www.synergeticpress.com/johnnydolphinmore.html","http://www.biospherics.org","http://www.architectureandvision.com/AV_WebSite/News/2008/03/","http://www.meandthebiospheres.com/","http://www.synergeticpress.com/authors/john-allen/","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_United_States.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/40px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","/wiki/File:Scientist.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Scientist.svg/40px-Scientist.svg.png","/wiki/File:Science-symbol-2.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Science-symbol-2.svg/30px-Science-symbol-2.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_P._Allen&action=edit","/wiki/Template:US-scientist-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:US-scientist-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:US-scientist-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_P._Allen&oldid=559248225","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:American_explorers","/wiki/Category:American_scientists","/wiki/Category:American_dramatists_and_playwrights","/wiki/Category:American_poets","/wiki/Category:Colorado_School_of_Mines_alumni","/wiki/Category:Harvard_Business_School_alumni","/wiki/Category:1929_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:American_scientist_stubs","/wiki/Category:Pages_using_citations_with_accessdate_and_no_URL","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+P.+Allen&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+P.+Allen","/wiki/John_P._Allen","/wiki/Talk:John_P._Allen","#","/wiki/John_P._Allen","/w/index.php?title=John_P._Allen&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_P._Allen&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_P._Allen&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/John_P._Allen","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/John_P._Allen","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=John_P._Allen&oldid=559248225","/w/index.php?title=John_P._Allen&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6251486","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=John_P._Allen&id=559248225","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=John+P.+Allen","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=John+P.+Allen&oldid=559248225&writer=rl"
