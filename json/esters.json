They are derived by reacting an oxoacid with a\n hydroxyl compound such as an alcohol or phenol. Esters are usually\n derived from an inorganic acid or organic acid in which at least one -OH\n (hydroxyl) group is replaced by an -O-alkyl (alkoxy) group, and most commonly\n from carboxylic acids and alcohols. That is, esters are formed by condensing an\n acid with an alcohol.\n\nEsters are ubiquitous. Most naturally occurring fats and oils (e.g.\ntriglycerides) are the fatty acid esters of glycerol. Esters with low molecular\nweight are commonly used as fragrances and found in essential oils and\npheromones. Phosphoesters form the backbone of DNA molecules. Nitrate esters,\nsuch as nitroglycerin, are known for their explosive properties, while\npolyesters are important plastics, with monomers linked by ester moieties. \n","linknr":-1,"url":"esters","recorded":1376428633,"links":[],"instances":["chemistry","fruit","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Functional groups","Esters|"],"headings":["Nomenclature","Structure and bonding","Physical properties and characterization","Applications and occurrence","Preparation","Reactions","List of ester odorants","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["product","chemistry"],["work-up","chemistry"],["poly(ethylene_terephthalate"],["orange","fruit"],["orange","fruit"]],"members":["orange","product"],"related":["Aryl","Chemical_compound","Carbonyl","Ether","Oxoacid","Hydroxyl","Alcohol","Phenols","Inorganic_acid","Organic_acid","Alkyl","Alkoxy","Carboxylic_acid","Alcohol","Condensation_reaction","Triglyceride","Fatty_acid","Glycerol","Essential_oil","Pheromone","Phosphoester","DNA","Nitrate_ester","Nitroglycerin","Polyester","Plastic","Leopold_Gmelin","Caprylic_acid","Butyl_acetate","N-Butanol","Acetic_acid","Lactone","Gamma-valerolactone","Orthoester","Orthoformic_acid","Ethanol","Phosphoric_acid","Sulfuric_acid","Nitric_acid","Boric_acid","Triphenyl_phosphate","Phosphoric_acid","Phenol","Ethylene_carbonate","Carbonic_acid","Ethylene_glycol","Carbonyl","Amide","Hydrogen_bond","Carboxylic_acid","IR_spectroscopy","Fat","Glycerol","Fatty_acid","Polyethylene_terephthalate","Acrylate_ester","Cellulose_acetate","Chemical_reaction","Product_(chemistry)","Fragrance","Flavoring","Polymer","Fischer_esterification","Sulfuric_acid","Dowex","Le_Chatelier's_principle","Molecular_sieves","Distillation","Azeotrope","Toluene","Dean-Stark_apparatus","Steglich_esterification","Peptide_synthesis","Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide","4-dimethylaminopyridine","Catalyst","Mitsunobu_reaction","Diazomethane","Gas_chromatography","Acyl_chloride","Acid_anhydride","Work-up_(chemistry)","Amide","Alkyl_halide","Alkyl_chloride","Finkelstein_reaction","Phase_transfer_catalyst","Aprotic_solvent","Dimethylformamide","Transesterification","Triglyceride","Poly(ethylene_terephthalate)","Dimethyl_terephthalate","Hydroesterification","Metal_carbonyl","Propionic_acid","Methanol","Methyl_formate","Formic_acid","Sodium_methoxide","Palladium","Acetic_acid","Oxygen","Vinyl_acetate","Vinyl_alcohol","Favorskii_rearrangement","Baeyer-Villiger_oxidation","Pinner_reaction","Nitrile","Nucleophilic_abstraction","Orthoesters","Adduct","Hydrolysis","Fischer_esterification","Hydroxide","Saponification","Ammonia","Amine","Amide","Isocyanate","Hydroxamic_acid","Lossen_rearrangement","Grignard_reagent","Fatty_alcohol","Copper_chromite","Catalytic_hydrogenation","Bouveault-Blanc_reduction","Lithium_aluminium_hydride","DIBAH","Aldehyde","Aldehydes","Alkoxide","Enolate","Claisen_condensation","Dieckmann_condensation","Malonic_ester_synthesis","Malonic_acid","Alkyl_halide","Fráter–Seebach_alkylation","Fries_rearrangement","Chan_rearrangement","Ester_pyrolysis","Protecting_group","Carboxylic_acid","Amino_acid","Isobutylene","Allyl_hexanoate","Pineapple","Benzyl_acetate","Pear","Strawberry","Jasmine","Bornyl_acetate","Pine","Butyl_acetate","Apple","Honey_bee","Butyl_butyrate","Pineapple","Ethyl_acetate","Nail_polish_remover","Scale_model","Paint","Model_aircraft","Adhesive","Ethyl_butyrate","Banana","Pineapple","Strawberry","Ethyl_hexanoate","Pineapple","Waxy-green_banana","Ethyl_cinnamate","Cinnamon","Ethyl_formate","Lemon","Rum","Strawberry","Ethyl_heptanoate","Apricot","Cherry","Grape","Raspberry","Ethyl_isovalerate","Apple","Ethyl_lactate","Butter","Cream","Ethyl_nonanoate","Grape","Ethyl_pentanoate","Apple","Geranyl_acetate","Pelargonium","Geranyl_butyrate","Cherry","Geranyl_pentanoate","Apple","Isobutyl_acetate","Cherry","Raspberry","Strawberry","Isobutyl_formate","Raspberry","Isoamyl_acetate","Pear","Banana","Pear_drop","Isopropyl_acetate","Linalyl_acetate","Lavender","Common_sage","Linalyl_butyrate","Peach","Linalyl_formate","Apple","Peach","Methyl_acetate","Glue","Methyl_anthranilate","Grape","Jasmine","Methyl_benzoate","Ylang_ylang","Feijoa","Methyl_butyrate","Pineapple","Apple","Strawberry","Methyl_cinnamate","Strawberry","Methyl_pentanoate","Flower","Methyl_phenylacetate","Honey","Methyl_salicylate","Oil_of_wintergreen","Root_beer","Wintergreen","Germolene","Ralgex","Nonyl_caprylate","Orange_(fruit)","Octyl_acetate","Orange_(fruit)","Octyl_butyrate","Parsnip","Amyl_acetate","Apple","Banana","Pentyl_butyrate","Apricot","Pear","Pineapple","Pentyl_hexanoate","Apple","Pineapple","Pentyl_pentanoate","Apple","Propyl_acetate","Pear","Propyl_hexanoate","Blackberry","Pineapple","Cheese","Wine","Propyl_isobutyrate","Rum","Terpenyl_butyrate","Cherry","Cyanate_ester","Oligoester","Polyolester","Transesterification","Transamidification"]}
