{"cursor":"47613","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\ns and sheep were among the first animals to be domesticated.]] 'Domestication'\n(from Latin {{lang|la|domesticus}}) is the process whereby a population of\nliving organisms is changed at the genetic level, through generations of\nselective breeding, to accentuate traits that ultimately benefit humans. A usual\nby-product of domestication is the creation of a dependency in the domesticated\norganisms, so that they lose their ability to live in the\nwild. \"Domestication.\" Dictionary.com. Based on the Random House Dictionary\n(Random House, Inc. 2013).\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/domesticate It differs from taming\nin that a change in the phenotypical expression and genotype of the animal\noccurs, whereas taming is simply the process by which animals become accustomed\nto human presence. In the Convention on Biological Diversity, a domesticated\nspecies is defined as a \"species in which the evolutionary process has been\ninfluenced by humans to meet their needs.\" See Article 2 (Use of Terms) of\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity Therefore, a defining\ncharacteristic of domestication is artificial selection by humans. Humans have\nbrought these populations under their control and care for a wide range of\nreasons: to produce food or valuable commodities (such as wool, cotton, or\nsilk), for types of work (such as transportation, protection, and warfare),\nscientific research, or simply to enjoy as companions or ornaments.\n\nPlants domesticated primarily for aesthetic enjoyment in and around the home are\nusually called house plants or ornamentals, while those domesticated for large-\nscale food production are generally called crops. A distinction can be made\nbetween those domesticated plants that have been deliberately altered or\nselected for special desirable characteristics (see cultigen) and those plants\nthat are used for human benefit, but are essentially no different from the wild\npopulations of the species. Animals domesticated for home companionship are\nusually called [[pet]]s while those domesticated for food or work are called\n[[livestock]] or farm animals.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Domestication","recorded":1376418433,"links":[],"instances":["horse","bird","animal","animal","insect","language","biology","fruit","botany","nutrition","cat","economics","legume"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Domesticated
