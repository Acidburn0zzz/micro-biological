There are two methods used: One is the digital rectal\nexamination (DRE), in which the examiner inserts a gloved, lubricated finger\ninto the rectum to examine the adjoining prostate. The other is the prostate-\nspecific antigen (PSA) blood test, which measures the concentration of this\nmolecule in the blood.\n\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against\nPSA screening in healthy men finding that the potential risks outweigh the\npotential benefits. Guidelines from the American\nUrological Association, and the American Cancer Society\nrecommend that men be informed of the risks and benefits of screening. The\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology recommends screening be discouraged in\nthose who are expected to live less than ten years, while in those with a life\nexpectancy of greater than ten years a decision should be made by the person in\nquestion based on the potential risks and benefits. In general, they conclude\nthat based on recent research, \"it is uncertain whether the benefits associated\nwith PSA testing for prostate cancer screening are worth the harms associated\nwith screening and subsequent unnecessary treatment.\" \n","linknr":-1,"url":"Prostate_cancer_screening","recorded":1376427988,"links":[],"instances":["united_states","united_states","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Male genital neoplasia","Cancer screening"],"headings":["Digital rectal examination","Prostate specific antigen","The screening controversy","Interpretation","Clinical practice guidelines","Research","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["food_and_drug_administration","united_states"],["medicare","united_states"],["screening","medicine"]],"members":["medicare","food_and_drug_administration","screening"],"related":["Prostate_cancer","Digital_rectal_examination","Prostate","Prostate-specific_antigen","Blood","United_States_Preventive_Services_Task_Force","USPSTF","American_Society_of_Clinical_Oncology","Rectal_examination","Prostate-specific_antigen","Enzyme","Serine_protease","Kallikrein","Spermatozoon","Cervix","Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)","Benign_prostatic_hypertrophy","Prostatitis","Finasteride","Dutasteride","Finasteride","Finasteride","Baldness","PSA_velocity","Medical_ultrasonography","Magnetic_resonance_imaging","PSA_density","Protein","United_States_Preventive_Services_Task_Force","USPSTF","Prostate_biopsy","Richard_J._Ablin","American_Urological_Association","Mayo_Clinic","New_England_Journal_of_Medicine","American_Cancer_Society","American_College_of_Preventive_Medicine","Medicare_(United_States)","United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs","American_Urological_Association","Clinical_prediction_rule","Prostate-specific_antigen","Medical_sign","Clinical_practice_guideline","Screening_(medicine)","United_States_Preventive_Services_Task_Force","USPSTF","American_Cancer_Society","US_Preventive_Services_Task_Force","American_Cancer_Society","National_Health_Service"]}
