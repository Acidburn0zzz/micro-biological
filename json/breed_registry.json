{"cursor":"19760","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'breed registry', also known as a 'herdbook', 'studbook' or 'register', in\nanimal husbandry and the hobby of animal fancy, is an official list of animals\nwithin a specific breed whose parents are known. Animals are usually registered\nby their breeders when they are still young. The terms \"studbook\" and \"register\"\nare also used to refer to lists of male animals \"standing at stud\", that is,\nthose animals actively breeding, as opposed to every known specimen of that\nbreed. Such registries usually issue certificates for each recorded animal,\ncalled a 'Pedigree,' 'Pedigreed animal documentation', or most commonly, an\nanimal's \"'papers'\". Registration papers may consist of a simple certificate or\na listing of ancestors in the animal's background, sometimes with a chart\nshowing the lineage.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"breed_registry","recorded":1376418389,"links":[],"instances":["horse","dog","sport","dog"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Breed registries|","Dog breeding","Horse breeding and studs"],"headings":["Types of registries","Types of stud books","Papers","Crossbreeding and backbreeding","Registered names and naming traditions","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["breed_club","dog"],["purebred","dog"],["man_o'_war","horse"],["cutting","sport"]],"members":["breed_club","cutting","purebred"],"related":["Animal_husbandry","Hobby","Animal_fancy","Breed","Registration_papers","Breed_club","Dog","Horse","Cow","Cat","Association_of_Zoos_and_Aquariums","Kennel_club","Breed_club_(dog)","Field_Dog_Stud_Book","Working_dog","Puppy_mill","Association_of_Zoos_and_Aquariums","Horse_breeding","Color_breed","Crossbreeding","Horse_show","Castration","American_Mixed_Breed_Obedience_Registry","Equestrianism","Horse","United_States_Equestrian_Federation","Foundation_bloodstock","Purebred","Thoroughbred","American_Kennel_Club","Kennel_club","Dog","Conformation_show","Gene_pool","Finnhorse","Trakehner","Studbook_selection","Horse_breed","Crossbred","American_Quarter_Horse","American_Kennel_Club","Color_breed","American_Quarter_Horse_Association","Color_breed","Appaloosa","American_Paint_Horse","American_Cream_Draft_Horse","Warmblood","Australia","Herding_dog","Border_Collie","Working_dog","Registration_papers","Pet_naming","Crossbreeding","Extinction","Inbreeding","Horse_show","Purebred","Purebred_(dog)","List_of_dog_sports","Conformation_show","Kennel_club","Pet_naming","Thoroughbred","Horse_racing","Man_o'_War_(horse)","Westminster_Kennel_Club_Dog_Show","K-Run's_Park_Me_In_First","Herding_dog","Breeder","Jockey_Club","Thoroughbred","Cutting_(sport)","Doc_O'Lena","Doc_Bar","Poco_Lena","Poco_Bueno","Kentucky_Derby","Funny_Cide","Distorted_Humor","Native_Dancer","Trademark","Kennel","Stable","Asterisk","Cat_registry","Cat_breeding","Dog_breeding","Horse_breeding","Kennel_club","Pedigreed_animal_documentation","Selective_breeding","Inbreeding","Coefficient_of_relationship","Pet_naming"]}
