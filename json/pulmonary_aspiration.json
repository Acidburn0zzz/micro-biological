A person may either inhale the material, or it may be delivered into the\ntracheobronchial tree during positive pressure ventilation. When pulmonary\naspiration occurs during eating and drinking, the aspirated material is often\ncolloquially referred to as \"going down the wrong pipe.\"\n\nConsequences of pulmonary aspiration range from no injury at all, to chemical\npneumonitis or pneumonia, to death within minutes from asphyxiation. These\nconsequences depend in part on the volume, chemical composition, particle size,\npresence or absence of infectious agents, and underlying health status of the\nperson. In healthy people, aspiration of small quantities of material is common\nand rarely results in disease or injury. People with significant underlying\ndisease or injury, especially hospitalized patients, are at greater risk for\ndeveloping respiratory complications following pulmonary aspiration because of\ncertain factors such as depressed level of consciousness and impaired airway\ndefenses (gag reflex and/or respiratory tract antimicrobial defense system).\n\nAs the lumen of the right main bronchus is more vertical and of slightly wider\ndiameter than that of the left, aspirated material is more likely to end up in\nthis bronchus or one of its subsequent .\n","linknr":-1,"url":"pulmonary_aspiration","recorded":1376428513,"links":[],"instances":["medicine","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anesthesia","Intensive care medicine","Lung disorders"],"headings":["Risk factors","Consequences","Prevention","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["complication","medicine"],["lumen","anatomy"]],"members":["complication","lumen"],"related":["Upper_respiratory_tract","Human_pharynx","Larynx","Lower_respiratory_tract","Vertebrate_trachea","Bronchus","Lung","Human_pharynx","Secretion","Oropharynx","Human_gastrointestinal_tract","Larynx","Lower_respiratory_tract","Respiratory_system","Vertebrate_trachea","Lung","Inhalation","Tracheobronchial_tree","Positive_pressure_ventilation","Chemical_pneumonitis","Pneumonia","Asphyxia","Comorbidity","Complication_(medicine)","Altered_level_of_consciousness","Pharyngeal_reflex","Respiratory_tract_antimicrobial_defense_system","Lumen_(anatomy)","Right_main_bronchus","Left_main_bronchus","Traumatic_brain_injury","Alcohol_intoxication","Drug_overdose","General_anaesthesia","Upper_esophageal_sphincter","Lower_esophageal_sphincter","Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease","Obesity","Pregnancy","Tracheal_intubation","Nasogastric_intubation","Feeding_tube","Hypoxemia","Gastric_acid","Chemical_reaction","Parenchyma","Inflammation","Bacterial_pneumonia","Community-acquired_pneumonia","Aspiration_pneumonia","Anaerobic_organism","Hospital-acquired_pneumonia","Aerobic_organism","Coughing","Swallowing","Coma","Drug_overdose","Sedation","General_anesthesia","Intensive_care","Ventilator","Pneumonia","Tracheal_intubation","Health_professional","First_aid","CPR","Vomitus","Pharynx","Neurological_disorder","Thickened_fluids","Abscess","Lingula_of_left_lung","Drowning","Mendelson's_syndrome","Salt_water_aspiration_syndrome","Choking"]}
