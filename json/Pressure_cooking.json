Pressure cookers are used for\ncooking food quicker than conventional cooking methods, which also saves energy.\n\nPressure cookers heat food quickly because the internal steam pressure from the\nboiling liquid causes saturated steam (or \"wet steam\") to bombard and permeate\nthe food. Thus, higher temperature water vapour (i.e., increased energy), which\ntransfers heat more rapidly compared to dry air, cooks food very quickly.\n\nPressure cooking allows food to be cooked with greater humidity and higher\ntemperatures than possible with conventional boiling or steaming methods. In an\nordinary non-pressurised cooking vessel, the boiling point of water is at\nstandard pressure; the temperature of food is limited by the boiling point of\nwater because excess heat causes boiling water to vaporize into steam. In a\nsealed pressure cooker, the boiling point of water increases as the pressure\nrises, resulting in superheated water. At a pressure of above atmospheric\npressure, water in a pressure cooker can reach a temperature of up to .\n\nPressure is created initially by boiling a liquid such as water or broth inside\nthe closed pressure cooker. The trapped steam increases the internal pressure\nand temperature. After use, the pressure is slowly released so that the vessel\ncan be safely opened.\n\nPressure cooking can be used to quickly simulate the effects of long braising or\nsimmering.\n\nAlmost any food which can be cooked in steam or water-based liquids can be\ncooked in a pressure cooker.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Pressure_cooking","recorded":1376428462,"links":[],"instances":["engineering","microbiology","cooking","metalworking","food","legume","metalworking"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Weapons of mass destruction","Cooking techniques","Pressure","Cookware and bakeware"],"headings":["History","Variants","Design","Generations","Pressure settings","Operation","Pressure release methods","Advantages","Disadvantages","Safety features","Use at high altitudes","Science of pressure cooking","Use in food detoxification","Foods unsuitable for pressure cooking","Use in terrorism","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["sterilization","microbiology"],["stamping","metalworking"],["polishing","metalworking"],["stock","food"],["deglazing","cooking"],["pulse","legume"],["interlock","engineering"]],"members":["interlock","sterilization","deglazing","stamping","stock","pulse","polishing"],"related":["Cooking","Pressure","Humidity","Temperature","Boiling","Steaming","Boiling_point","Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure","Evaporation","Steam","Superheated_water","Atmospheric_pressure","Braising","Simmering","Denis_Papin","Hermetic_seal","Royal_Society_of_London","Stuttgart","Cast_iron","Zaragoza","1939_New_York_World's_Fair","National_Presto_Industries","United_States","Canning","Home_canning","Botulism","Microorganism","Sterilization_(microbiology)","Gasket","Aluminum","Stainless_steel","Stamping_(metalworking)","Polishing_(metalworking)","Anodizing","Dishwasher","Copper-clad_steel","Heat_spreader","Thermal_conductivity","Non-stick_surface","Silicone","Pressure_regulator","Safety_valve","Flange","Bayonet_mount","Lens_mount","Home_canning","Piston","Steam_engine","United_States_Department_of_Agriculture","Vapour_pressure_of_water","Christmas_pudding","Slow_cooker","Stock_(food)","Steaming","Trivet","Gauge_pressure","Relief_valve","Nozzle","Leavening_agent","Roasting","Pan_frying","Deep_frying","KFC","Sauce","Pleat","Thermal_conductivity","Fat","Deglazing_(cooking)","Stew","Leavening_agent","Microwave_oven","Boiling","Steaming","Saucepan","Vitamin","Mineral","Boiling_point","Jam","Baby_bottle","Camping","Maillard_reaction","Seasoning","Saucepan","Gasket","Lid","Saucepan","Timer","Camping","Pulse_(legume)","Lentil","Interlock_(engineering)","Alloy","Grommet","Gasket","Gas_stove","European_Union","Pressure_Equipment_Directive","Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure","Charles_Darwin","Sherpa_people","Boiling_point","Oven","Kettle","Aflatoxin","Macaroni","Cranberry","Cereal","Oatmeal","Pressure_cooker_bomb","2006_Mumbai_train_bombings","2010_Stockholm_bombings","2010_Times_Square_car_bombing_attempt","Boston_Marathon_bombings","Pressure_frying","Rice_cooker"]}
