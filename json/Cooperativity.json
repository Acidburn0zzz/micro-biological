{"cursor":"4874","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Cooperativity' is a phenomenon displayed by enzymes or receptors that have\nmultiple binding sites where the affinity of the binding sites for a ligand is\nincreased, positive cooperativity, or decreased, negative cooperativity, upon\nthe binding of a ligand to a binding site. For example the affinity of\nhemoglobin's four binding sites for oxygen is increased above that of the\nunbound hemoglobin when the first oxygen molecule binds. This is referred to as\ncooperative binding. Whitford, David: Proteins:\nstructure and function, 2005, John Wiley & Sons, pages 66-74 We also see\ncooperativity in large chain molecules made of many identical (or nearly\nidentical) subunits (such as DNA, proteins, and phospholipids), when such\nmolecules undergo phase transitions such as melting, unfolding or unwinding.\nThis is referred to as subunit cooperativity.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Cooperativity","recorded":1376428510,"links":[],"instances":["biochemistry","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biomolecules","Cell signaling","Chemical bonding","Enzyme kinetics","Receptors"],"headings":["Cooperative binding","Subunit cooperativity","Entropy and cooperativity","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["receptor","biochemistry"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["receptor","transcription"],"related":["Enzyme","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Binding_site","Cooperative_binding","DNA","Protein","Phospholipid","Ligands","Oxygen","Hemoglobin","Oxygen","Ferrous_iron","Hemoglobin","Oxygen","Oxygen","Oxygen","Hemoglobin","Sigmoid_function","Hyperbolic_function","Myoglobin","Hemoglobin","Oxygen","Oxygen-hemoglobin_dissociation_curve","Ligand","Protein","Protein","Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate","Enzyme","DNA","DNA_replication","Transcription_(genetics)","Genetic_recombination","Nucleotide","Cooperative_unit_size","Phospholipid","Cell_membrane","Entropy","Hemoglobin"]}
