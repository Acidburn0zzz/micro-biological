Pebbles are generally considered to\nbe larger than granules (2 to 4 millimetres diameter) and smaller than\ncobbles (64 to 256 millimetres diameter). A rock made predominantly of\npebbles is termed a conglomerate. Pebble tools are among the earliest known man-\nmade artifacts, dating from the Palaeolithic period of human history.\n\nA beach composed chiefly of surface pebbles is commonly termed a shingle beach.\nThis type of beach has armoring characteristics with respect to wave erosion, as\nwell as ecological niches which can provide habitat for animals and plants.\n\nPebbles come in various colors and textures, and can have streaks of quartz and\ndifferent colored sedimentary rock. Pebbles are mostly smooth but, dependent on\nhow frequently they come in contact with the sea, they can have marks of contact\nwith other rocks or other pebbles. Pebbles left above the high water mark may\nhave growths of organisms such as lichen on them, signifying the lack of contact\nwith seawater.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Pebble","recorded":1376428515,"links":[],"instances":["geology","grain_size","hydrology","geology","geology","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stone","Sedimentology","Granular materials","Building stone","Natural materials"],"headings":["Location","Uses","Gallery","References","See also"],"image":[],"tags":[["rock","geology"],["particle_size","grain_size"],["granule","geology"],["cobble","geology"],["conglomerate","geology"],["armor","hydrology"]],"members":["cobble","particle_size","armor","rock","granule","conglomerate"],"related":["Somerset","Clastic_rocks","Rock_(geology)","Particle_size","Particle_size_(grain_size)","Sedimentology","Granule_(geology)","Cobble_(geology)","Conglomerate_(geology)","Oldowan","Palaeolithic","Shingle_beach","Armor_(hydrology)","Erosion","Habitat","Quartz","Tide","Lichen","Seawater","River","Estuary","Pacific_Ocean","Norwegian_Sea","River","Soil","Water_current","Wind_wave","Landscaping","Building_construction","Bookends","Paperweight","Pet_rocks","Beach","Halite","Dead_Sea","Israel","Gravel"]}
