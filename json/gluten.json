Gluten gives elasticity to dough, helping it rise and keep its shape\nand often gives the final product a chewy texture. Gluten may also be found in\nsome cosmetics, hair products, and other dermatological preparations.\n\nGluten is the composite of a [[gliadin]] and a [[glutenin]], which is conjoined\nwith starch in the endosperm of various grass-related grains. The prolamin and\nglutelin from wheat (gliadin, which is alcohol-soluble, and glutenin, which is\nonly soluble in dilute acids or alkalis) constitute about 80% of the protein\ncontained in wheat fruit. Being insoluble in water, they can be purified by\nwashing away the associated starch. Worldwide, gluten is a source of protein,\nboth in foods prepared directly from sources containing it, and as an additive\nto foods otherwise low in protein.\n\nThe fruit of most flowering plants have endosperms with stored protein to\nnourish embryonic plants during germination. True gluten, with gliadin and\nglutenin, is limited to certain members of the grass family. The stored proteins\nof maize and rice are sometimes called glutens, but their proteins differ from\ntrue gluten.\n\nAbout 1 in 133 people in developed nations have allergic reactions to\ngluten, some of which can be severe enough to be life-threatening.\n\nBuddhist monks discovered gluten in the 7th century. The monks, who were\nvegetarians, were trying to find a substitute for meat. They discovered that\nwhen they submerged dough in water, the starch washed off and all that was left\nwas a meat-like, textured, gummy mass - Gluten. http://www.buzzle.com/articles/what-is-\ngluten.html\n","linknr":-1,"url":"gluten","recorded":1376418401,"links":[],"instances":["food","food","food","food","grinding","food","biochemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Glutens","Nutrition","Seed storage proteins"],"headings":["Extraction","Uses","Adverse reactions","Labeling","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["suspension","chemistry"],["mill","grinding"],["fermentation","food"],["denaturation","biochemistry"],["wheat_gluten","food"],["chicken","food"],["duck","food"],["fish","food"]],"members":["chicken","wheat_gluten","duck","fish","mill","fermentation","denaturation","suspension"],"related":["Spelt","Barley","Rye_flakes","Glue","Protein","Wheat","Barley","Rye","Viscoelasticity","Dough","Leavening_agent","Chewiness","Starch","Endosperm","Triticeae_glutens","Cereal","Prolamin","Glutenin","Fruit","Solubility","Food_additive","Low-protein_diet","Flowering_plant","Plant_embryogenesis","Germination","Poaceae","Maize","Rice","Gluten_sensitivity","Flour","Dough","Starch","Suspension_(chemistry)","Sedimentation","Salt","Impurity","Slurry","Centrifugation","Screw_press","Atomizer_nozzle","Drying","Air_cooling","Pneumatics","Sieve","Mill_(grinding)","Molecule","Viscosity","Leavening_agent","Yeast","Fermentation_(food)","Carbon_dioxide","Baking","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Staling","Multivariate_analysis","Pizza","Bagel","Pastry","Bread","Flour","Kneading","No-knead_bread","Shortening","Farinograph","Bread_machine","Food_processor","Wheat_gluten_(food)","Meat_analogue","Chicken_(food)","Duck_(food)","Mock_duck","Fish_(food)","Pork","Beef","Broth","Beer","Soy_sauce","Food_additive","Ice_cream","Ketchup","Coeliac_disease","Pet_food","Coeliac_disease","Wheat_allergy","Gluten_sensitivity","International_standard","Food_labelling","Food_Standards_Agency","US_Food_and_Drug_Administration","Generally_recognized_as_safe"]}
