{"cursor":"5819","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Wesley C. Salmon' (1925 â April 22, 2001) was a contemporary philosopher\nof science concerned primarily with issues related to the metaphysics of\ncausation and explanation.\n\nSalmon taught in the History and Philosophy of Science programs at Indiana\nUniversity Bloomington, where he was one of the founding members of the program,\nin the Department of Philosophy at the University of Arizona and then for the\nremainder of his career at University of Pittsburgh. He earned his PhD in\nphilosophy from UCLA under the direction of Hans Reichenbach.\n\nA major feature of Salmonâs work consists of providing a philosophically sound\nbasis for scientific explanation. Salmon claimed that a scientific explanation\nis the state of affairs of something fitting into or being a part of a pattern\nin the world, where the pattern is constituted by at least one causal process. A\nprocess is the real physical connection between cause and effect. For example,\nthe heat from the flame of a gas stove excites the molecules in the water via\nthe iron atoms in the bottom of the pan. This is a process where every step from\nthe cause, the flame, can be traced to the effect, boiling water. This view has\ncome to be known as the âonticâ account of explanation, specifically a causal-\nmechanical model of explanation, which involved mechanism (biology). It is\nthoroughly realist and rests on an ontology that is designed to answer the\nquestion: \"Just what is a causal process?\"\n\nSalmon argued that events are intersections of two or more causal processes.\nThis interpretation leads to depicting the world as a network with lines (causal\nprocesses) and nodes (intersections of causal processes â events). Thus\nevents, causes and effects are reduced to causal processes, where causal\nprocesses are real connections between events. According to Salmon, causal\nprocesses transmit 'structure', or energy and momentum or 'information' from one\nspatio-temporal location to another. There are two ways, in principle, by which\nit is possible to demarcate causal processes from 'pseudo-processes' â how\ncausal processes are transmitted through space-time and what they transmit. As\nfor how causal processes are transmitted, the theory holds that the\ntransmissions must be continuous, with no discontinuities or 'jumps' in space-\ntime. Unfortunately this is not enough to be sure that it is a genuinely causal\nprocess, as 'pseudo-processes' can also be continuous.\n\nDemarcation requires that it is necessary to examine what causal processes\ntransmit. Salmon argued causal processes transmit information, and as such we\nshould be able to 'mark' a process by modifying it, to see if the modification\nis transmitted. This 'marking principal' serves to demarcate causal process from\npseudo-processes, as the latter cannot be marked. Further to this, 'things' are\n'causal agents' if they are originators of causal chains and not merely 'passers\non' of causes. They are 'uncaused causers'. The 'uncaused causer' is the first\ncause in a new causal chain. It is the initial cause in the chain of causal\nevents we are interested in explaining. The uncaused causer obviously had a\ncause of its own, but in terms of the phenomenon that we are attempting to\nexplain, the uncaused causer's cause is irrelevant\n\nSalmon's ontology of causal processes seems to fit scientific explanations very\nwell. For example, genes are very much 'causal agents'. Geneticists have\ninserted the 'antifreeze' genes from flounders into the genetic code of\ntomatoes. This then protects the tomatoes from frost damage. A process (normal\nreproduction) has been marked, such that the information that is transmitted\n(the DNA) is modified (the addition of the flounder gene). Genes, therefore, are\na part of a genuine causal process. Specifically, genes are made up of DNA.\nInside the cell nucleus, a particular nitrogen-base sequence of DNA controls\nprecisely what proteins are formed in the cytoplasm. By controlling the\nsynthesis of proteins, DNA determines what chemical reactions take place in the\ncell. The chemical reactions of cells affect the chemical reactions of the body.\nA small chemical change to the way a particular molecule forms can produce a\nconsiderable effect on the phenotype.\n\nHere we have a detailed account of the way genes cause phenotypic effects. DNA\nis information that tells the cell what kind of proteins to form. This, in turn,\ngoverns the chemical reactions in the cell, which then produces a phenotypic\neffect. The gene is the 'uncaused causer' in the chain of causal events we are\ntrying to explain.\n\nSalmon also contributed to Bayesian concepts of probability. He attempted to\nexplain Thomas Kuhn in terms of Bayes' theorem in an article called \"Rationality\nand Objectivity\".\n\nHe died in a car crash.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Wesley_Salmon","recorded":1376426669,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Wesley_C._Salmon&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Wesley_C._Salmon&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_C._Salmon","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Wesley_Salmon&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Contemporary_philosophy","/wiki/Philosophy_of_science","/wiki/Causality","/wiki/Explanation","/wiki/Indiana_University_Bloomington","/wiki/University_of_Arizona","/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh","/wiki/PhD","/wiki/UCLA","/wiki/Hans_Reichenbach","/wiki/Explanation","/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)","/wiki/Philosophical_realism","/wiki/Ontology","/wiki/Energy","/wiki/Momentum","/wiki/Space-time","/wiki/Demarcation_problem","/wiki/Genes","/wiki/DNA","/wiki/Cell_nucleus","/wiki/Proteins","/wiki/Cytoplasm","/wiki/Phenotype","/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn","/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem","/wiki/Car_crash","/w/index.php?title=Wesley_C._Salmon&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Wesley_C._Salmon&veaction=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Wesley_C._Salmon&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Wesley_C._Salmon&veaction=edit&section=2","http://lists.ccil.org/pipermail/philnet/2001-May/000100.html","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/108517517","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wesley_C._Salmon&oldid=542542330","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Philosophers_of_science","/wiki/Category:1925_births","/wiki/Category:2001_deaths","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Wesley+C.+Salmon&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Wesley+C.+Salmon","/wiki/Wesley_C._Salmon","/wiki/Talk:Wesley_C._Salmon","#","/wiki/Wesley_C._Salmon","/w/index.php?title=Wesley_C._Salmon&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Wesley_C._Salmon&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Wesley_C._Salmon&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Wesley_C._Salmon","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Wesley_C._Salmon","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Wesley_C._Salmon&oldid=542542330","/w/index.php?title=Wesley_C._Salmon&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327630","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Wesley_C._Salmon&id=542542330","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Wesley+C.+Salmon","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Wesley+C.+Salmon&oldid=542542330&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Wesley_C._Salmon&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_C._Salmon","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D1%8D%D0%BB%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BD,_%D0%A3%D1%8D%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B8","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_C._Salmon","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327630#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_C._Salmon","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/
