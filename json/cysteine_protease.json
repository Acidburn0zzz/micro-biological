These proteases share a common catalytic mechanism that\ninvolves a nucleophilic cysteine thiol in a catalytic dyad.\n\nCysteine proteases are commonly encountered in fruits including the papaya,\npineapple, fig and kiwifruit. The proportion of protease tends to be higher when\nthe fruit is unripe. In fact, dozens of latices of different plant families are\nknown to contain cysteine proteases. Cysteine\nproteases are used as an ingredient in meat tenderizers.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"cysteine_protease","recorded":1376427642,"links":[],"instances":["biochemistry","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 3.4.22|*"],"headings":["Classification","Catalytic mechanism","Biological importance","Examples","Regulation","Potential pharmacological uses","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["family","biology"],["substrate","biochemistry"],["cell","biology"],["substrate","biochemistry"]],"members":["substrate","cell","family"],"related":["Papain","Enzyme","Protein","Catalysis","Nucleophile","Cysteine","Thiol","Fruits","Papaya","Pineapple","Common_fig","Kiwifruit","Latex","Family_(biology)","Meat_tenderizer","Protonation","Thiol","Enzyme","Amino_acid","Side_chain","Histidine","Deprotonated","Anion","Sulfur","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Carbonyl","Carbon","Amine","Histidine","Protease","Thioester","Carboxy-terminus","Thiol","Thioester","Hydrolysis","Carboxylic_acid","Senescence","Apoptosis","Signalling_pathway","Biotic_component","Abiotic","Immune_response","Prohormone","Extracellular_matrix","Macrophages","Collagen","Elastin","Inflammation","Diseases","Atherosclerosis","Emphysema","Traditional_medicine","Intestinal_parasite","Infections","Livestock","Actinidain","Bromelain","Calpains","Caspases","Cathepsins","Mir1-CP","Papain","Zymogens","Serine_protease","Trypsinogen","Chymotrypsinogen","Aspartic_protease","Pepsinogen","Lysosome","Stomach","Cell_(biology)","Enzyme_inhibitor","Structural_domain","Active_site","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Competitive_inhibition","Non-competitive_inhibition","Allosteric_site","Serpin","Stefin","Inhibitor_of_apoptosis","TIMP","Anthelmintic","Proteolysis","Nematode","Arthropod_cuticle","Tapeworm","Porcine","Acanthocephala","Oral_administration","Cuticle","The_Proteolysis_Map","MEROPS"]}
