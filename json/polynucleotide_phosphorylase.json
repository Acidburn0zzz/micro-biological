PDB 1e3p.\n}} 'Polynucleotide Phosphorylase' ('PNPase') is a bifunctional enzyme with a\nphosphorolytic 3' to 5' exoribonuclease activity and a 3'-terminal\noligonucleotide polymerase activity. That is, it\ndismantles the RNA chain starting at the 3' end and working toward the 5'\nend. It also synthesizes long, highly\nheteropolymeric tails in vivo. It accounts for all of the observed residual\npolyadenylylation in strains of Escherichia coli missing the normal\npolyadenylylation enzyme.\n\nIt is involved on mRNA processing and degradation in bacteria, plants, and in humans.\n\nIn humans, the enzyme is encoded by the gene. In its active form, the protein\nforms a ring structure consisting of three PNPase molecules. Each PNPase\nmolecule consists of two RNase PH domains, an S1 RNA binding domain and a K-\nhomology domain. The protein is present in bacteria and in the chloroplasts and mitochondria of some\neukaryotic cells. In eukaryotes and archaea, a structurally and evolutionary\nrelated complex exists, called the ''exosome''.\n\nThe same abbreviation (PNPase) is also used for another, otherwise unrelated\nenzyme, Purine nucleoside phosphorylase.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"polynucleotide_phosphorylase","recorded":1376418391,"links":[],"instances":["animal_test"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ribonucleases","EC 2.7.7","Genes mutated in mice"],"headings":["Model organisms","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["open_field","animal_test"]],"members":["open_field"],"related":["Proteinâ€“protein_interaction","Enzyme","Phosphorolysis","Exoribonuclease","Oligonucleotide","Polymerase","Polyadenylylation","MRNA_processing","RNase_PH","Protein_K","Bacteria","Chloroplasts","Mitochondria","Eukaryotic","Eukaryote","Archaea","Exosome_complex","Purine_nucleoside_phosphorylase","Homozygote","Recessive","Open_Field_(animal_test)","Hot_plate_test","Dysmorphology","Indirect_calorimetry","Glucose_tolerance_test","Auditory_brainstem_response","Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry","Radiography","Clinical_chemistry","Blood_plasma","Immunoglobulin","Haematology","Peripheral_blood_lymphocyte","Micronucleus_test","Model_organism","Knockout_mouse","International_Knockout_Mouse_Consortium","Phenotypic_screen","Mutant","Homozygous","Mutant","Weaning","Heterozygous"]}
