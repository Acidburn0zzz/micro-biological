It is found naturally in many plants, notably in high\nconcentration in the tonka bean (Dipteryx odorata), vanilla grass (Anthoxanthum\nodoratum), sweet woodruff (Galium odoratum), mullein (Verbascum spp.), sweet\ngrass (Hierochloe odorata), cassia cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia), sweet-clover\n(Melilotus ssp.), and deertongue (Dichanthelium clandestinum). The name comes\nfrom a French term for the tonka bean, coumarou. It has a sweet odor, readily\nrecognised as the scent of new-mown hay, and has been used in perfumes since\n1882. Sweet woodruff, sweet grass and sweet-clover in particular are named for\ntheir sweet smell, which in turn is due to their high content of this substance.\nWhen it occurs in high concentrations in forage plants, coumarin is a somewhat\nbitter-tasting appetite suppressant, and is presumed to be produced by plants as\na defense chemical in order to discourage predation.\n\nCoumarin has been used as an aroma enhancer in pipe tobaccos and certain\nalcoholic drinks, although in general it is banned as a flavorant food additive,\ndue to concerns regarding its hepatotoxicity in animal models.\n\nAlthough coumarin itself has no anticoagulant properties, it is transformed into\nthe natural anticoagulant dicoumarol by a number of species of fungi. This\noccurs as the result of the production of 4-hydroxycoumarin, then further (in\nthe presence of naturally occurring formaldehyde) into the actual anticoagulant\ndicoumarol, a fermentation product and mycotoxin. This substance was responsible\nfor the bleeding disease known historically as \"sweet clover disease\" in cattle\neating moldy sweet clover silage. Bye, A. and H. K. King. 1970. The\nbiosynthesis of 4-hydroxycoumarin and dicoumarol by Aspergillus fumigatus\nFresenius. Biochemical Journal 117, 237-45.\n\nCoumarin is used in the pharmaceutical industry as a precursor molecule in the\nsynthesis of a number of synthetic anticoagulant pharmaceuticals similar to\ndicoumarol, the notable ones being warfarin (brand name Coumadin) and some even\nmore potent rodenticides that work by the same anticoagulant mechanism.\nCoumarins are a type of vitamin K antagonists. Pharmaceutical coumarins were all\ndeveloped from the study of sweet clover disease.\n\nCoumarin has clinical medical value by itself, as an edema modifier. Coumarin\nand other benzopyrones, such as 5,6-benzopyrone, 1,2-benzopyrone, diosmin, and\nothers, are known to stimulate macrophages to degrade extracellular albumen,\nallowing faster resorption of edematous fluids.

Also in 1820, Nicholas Jean Baptiste Gaston Guibourt (1790-\n1867) of France independently isolated coumarin, but he realized that it was not\nbenzoic acid. Guibourt, N. J. B. G. Histoire AbrÃ©gÃ©e des Droques Simples\n(Abridged History of Simple Drugs). Volume 2. Paris, L. Colas. 1820.\n[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ucm.5324210081#view=1up;seq=166 pages 160-\n161]. In a subsequent essay he presented to the pharmacy section of\nl'AcadÃ©mie royale de MÃ©decine, Guibourt named the new substance\n\"coumarine\".
