In\n fish breeding, those parents frequently are two closely related fish species,\n while in plant and animal genetics those parents usually are two inbred\n lines. Mules are F1 hybrids between horse and donkey. Today, certain domestic\n hybrid breeds, such as the Savannah cat, are classified by their filial\n generation number.\n\nGregor Mendel's groundbreaking work in the 19th century focused on patterns of\ninheritance and the genetic basis for variation. In his cross-pollination\nexperiments involving two true-breeding, or homozygous, parents, Mendel found\nthat the resulting F1 generation were heterozygous and consistent. The offspring\nshowed a combination of those phenotypes from each of the parents that were\ngenetically dominant. Mendelâs discoveries involving the F1 and F2 generation\nlaid the foundation for modern genetics.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"F1_hybrid","recorded":1376418410,"links":[],"instances":["genetics","genetics","physiology","biology","cat"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Agronomy","Classical genetics","Plant reproduction","Pollination management","Breeding"],"headings":["Production of F1 hybrids","Advantages","Disadvantages","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["savannah","cat"],["variation","genetics"],["dominance","genetics"],["hybrid","biology"],["sterility","physiology"]],"members":["dominance","variation","sterility","hybrid","savannah"],"related":["Genetics","Selective_breeding","Generation","Mule","Horse","Donkey","Savannah_(cat)","Gregor_Mendel","Inheritance","Genetics","Variation_(genetics)","Cross-pollination","Homozygous","Heterozygous","Phenotypes","Dominance_(genetics)","Hybrid_(biology)","Seed","Peppermint","Sterility_(physiology)","Watermint","Mentha_spicata","Agronomy","Cultivar","Pollination","Maize","Phenotype","Inbreeding","Homozygous","Heterosis","Population","Inbreeding","Self-fertilization","United_States","Automatic_pollinator","Cichlid","Pure_line","Phenotype","Population","Allele","Protein","Enzyme","Genetic_defect","Heterosis","Genetic_assortment","Backcrossing","Heterosis","Genetics","Heirloom_plant"]}
