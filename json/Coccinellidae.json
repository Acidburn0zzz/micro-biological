They are commonly yellow, orange, or scarlet with small black\nspots on their wing covers, with black legs, heads and antennae. Such colour\npatterns vary greatly, however; for example, a minority of species, such as\n[[Vibidia duodecimguttata]], a twelve-spotted species, have whitish spots on a\nbrown background. Coccinellids are found worldwide, with over 5,000 species\ndescribed, Judy Allen & Tudor Humphries (2000). Are You A Ladybug?,\nKingfisher, p. 30 more than 450 native to North America alone.\n\nCoccinellidae are known colloquially as 'ladybirds' (in Britain, Ireland and the\nCommonwealth), 'ladybugs' (originating in North America) or 'lady cows', among\nother names.

When they need to use a common name, entomologists\nwidely prefer the names 'ladybird beetles' or 'lady beetles' White, R.E.\n1983. A field guide to the beetles of North America. Peterson Field Guide Series\n#29. as these insects are not true bugs.\n\nThe Coccinellidae are generally considered useful insects, because many species\nfeed on aphids or scale insects, which are pests in gardens, agricultural\nfields, orchards, and similar places. Within the colonies of such plant-eating\npests, they will lay hundreds of eggs, and when these hatch the larvae will\ncommence feeding immediately. http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals-\n/bugs/ladybug/?source=A-to-Z However, some species do have unwelcome\neffects. Among these, the most prominent are the subfamily Epilachninae, which\nare plant eaters. Usually, Epilachninae are only mild agricultural pests, eating\nthe leaves of grain, potatoes, beans, and various other crops, but their numbers\ncan increase explosively in years when their natural enemies are few, such as\nparasitoid wasps that attack their eggs. When that happens, they can do major\ncrop damage. They occur in practically all the major crop-producing regions of\ntemperate and tropical countries.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Coccinellidae","recorded":1376427531,"links":[],"instances":["finland","film","zoology","europe","mother_of_jesus","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Coccinellidae|","Cucujoidea","Biological pest control agents"],"headings":["Etymology","Physical appearance","Biology","Infestations and impacts","Ladybird survey","In popular culture","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["family","biology"],["antenna","biology"],["mary","mother_of_jesus"],["cannibalism","zoology"],["summer_of_1976","europe"],["james_and_the_giant_peach","film"],["swedish_people's_party","finland"]],"members":["james_and_the_giant_peach","cannibalism","summer_of_1976","mary","antenna","family"],"related":["Animal","Arthropod","Insect","Beetle","Polyphaga","Cucujoidea","Pierre_André_Latreille","Chilocorinae","Coccidulinae","Coccinellinae","Epilachninae","Hyperaspidinae","Microweiseinae","Scymninae","Sticholotidinae","Family_(biology)","Beetle","Elytra","Antenna_(biology)","North_America","Commonwealth_of_Nations","Entomology","Hemiptera","Aphid","Scale_insect","Taxonomic_rank","Epilachninae","Parasitoid","Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)","Seven_Joys_of_the_Virgin","Our_Lady_of_Sorrows","Entomologist","Tortoise_beetle","Scarabaeidae","Grapevine_beetles","Chrysomelidae","Melyridae","Tortoise_beetle","Pupa","Elytron","Exoskeleton","Potato","Predator","Sternorrhyncha","Aphids","Scale_insects","Biological_pest_control","Spotted_lady_beetle","Spodoptera","Plutellidae","Cannibalism_(zoology)","Monophlebidae","Trophic_egg","Epilachninae","Herbivore","Agricultural_pest","Mexican_bean_beetle","Fungivore","Biological_control","Aposematism","Phenotype","Reflex_bleeding","Diapause","Instar","Pupa","Teneral","Larva","Pupa","Summer_of_1976_(Europe)","Ladybird_taint","Sexual_intercourse","Cornwall","Devon","New_Forest","Suffolk","Norfolk_dialect","Elytra","Nursery_rhyme","Bed_warmer","Robert_Schumann","Poland","Nursery_rhyme","Virgin_Mary","Europe","Freyja","Fertility","Goddess","Norse_mythology","Virgin_Mary","Old_Norse","Norwegian_language","German_language","Blessed_Virgin_Mary","Irish_language","Polish_language","Dutch_language","Hebrew","Yiddish","Moshe_Rabbenu","Messiah","Michael_Wex","Anthropomorphic","Roald_Dahl","Minibeast","James_and_the_Giant_Peach_(film)","Jane_Leeves","Dennis_Leary","Tree_Fu_Tom","Ledyba","Ledian","Pokémon","Electro-Wave_Human_Tackle","Tokusatsu","Cartoon_Network","Logo","Ladybird_Books","Pearson_PLC","Woolworths.co.uk","Woolworths_Group_plc","Biedronka","Atmel_AVR","Axosoft","Politics_of_Finland","Swedish_People's_Party_(Finland)","Senseless_Violence","List_of_U.S._state_insects","Delaware","Massachusetts","New_Hampshire","New_York","Ohio","Tennessee","United_States","Alpha_Sigma_Alpha","Sorority","Candanchú","Canfranc","High_Aragon","Pyrenees","Province_of_Huesca","Spain","University_of_Florida","Institute_of_Food_and_Agricultural_Sciences"]}
