When cells are lysed for these studies, proteases, many of\nwhich are contained within lysosomes, are released. These proteases, if freely\npresent in the lysate, would destroy any products from the reaction being\nstudied, and make the experiment uninterpretable. For example, leupeptin could\nbe used in a calpain extraction to keep calpain from being hydrolyzed by\nspecific proteases. The suggested concentration is 1-10 ÂµM (0.5-\n5 Âµg/ml).\n\nLeupeptin is an organic compound produced by actinomycetes, which inhibits\nserine, cysteine and threonine proteases. Leupeptin inhibits serine proteinases\n(trypsin (K i=3.5 nM), plasmin (K i= 3.4 nM),\nporcine kallikrein), and cysteine proteinases (papain, cathepsin B\n(K i = 4.1 nM), endoproteinase Lys-C). It does not inhibit Î±-\nchymotrypsin or thrombin. Leupeptin is a competitive transition state inhibitor\nand its inhibition may be relieved by an excess of substrate.\n\nLeupeptin is soluble in water (stable for 1 week at 4 Â°C and 1 month at\nâ20 Â°C), ethanol, acetic acid and DMF.\n\nIt can be given topically for middle and inner ear infections.
