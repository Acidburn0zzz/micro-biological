Roman Catholics, the Eastern\nOrthodox, Anglicans, and Lutherans refer to him as \"Saint Michael the\nArchangel\" and also as \"Saint Michael\". Orthodox Christians refer to him as the\n\"Taxiarch Archangel Michael\" or simply \"Archangel Michael\".\n\nIn Hebrew, Michael means \"who is like God?\". Michael is mentioned three times in\nthe Book of Daniel, once as a \"great prince who stands up for the children of\nyour people\". The idea that Michael was the advocate of the Jews became so\nprevalent that in spite of the rabbinical prohibition against appealing to\nangels as intermediaries between God and his people, Michael came to occupy a\ncertain place in the Jewish liturgy.\n\nIn the New Testament Michael leads God's armies against Satan's forces in the\nBook of Revelation, where during the war in heaven he defeats Satan. In the\nEpistle of Jude Michael is specifically referred to as an \"archangel\". Christian\nsanctuaries to Michael appeared in the 4th century, when he was first seen as a\nhealing angel, and then over time as a protector and the leader of the army of\nGod against the forces of evil. By the 6th century, devotions to Archangel\nMichael were widespread both in the Eastern and Western Churches. Over time,\nteachings on Michael began to vary among Christian denominations.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Archangel_Michael","recorded":1376429137,"links":[],"instances":["spirituality","vienna","roman_catholic","christianity","archangel","324","lutheran","archangel","bishop","belgrade","christianity","bach"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Michael
