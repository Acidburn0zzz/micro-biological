It was based on the skills required of the working\nvaqueros and later, cowboys, in what today is the western United States, western\nCanada, and northern Mexico. Today it is a sporting event that consists of\nevents that involve horses and other livestock, designed to test the skill and\nspeed of the human cowboy and cowgirl athletes who participate. Professional\nrodeos generally comprise the following events: tie-down roping, team roping,\nsteer wrestling, saddle bronc riding, bareback bronc riding, bull riding and\nbarrel racing. The events are divided into two basic categories: the rough stock\nevents and the timed events. Depending on sanctioning organization and region,\nother events such as breakaway roping, goat tying, or pole bending may also be a\npart of some rodeos.\n\nRodeo, particularly popular today within the Canadian province of Alberta and\nthroughout the western United States, is the official state sport of Wyoming,\nSouth Dakota, and Texas. The iconic silhouette image of a \"Bucking Horse and\nRider\" is a federal and state-registered trademark of the State of\nWyoming. General Wyoming Information, web site accessed July 12, 2007 at\nhttp://www.netstate.com/states/symb/wy_symb.htm The Legislative Assembly\nof Alberta has considered making rodeo the official sport of that province.\nHowever, enabling legislation has yet to be passed. https://www.getgrowingforbusiness.com/mynews/news-headlines-\ndetails.asp?news_id=301869\n\nIn North America, professional rodeos are governed and sanctioned by the\nProfessional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) and Womenâs Professional Rodeo\nAssociation (WPRA), while other associations govern children's, high school,\ncollegiate, and senior rodeos. Associations also exist for Native Americans and\nother minority groups. The traditional season for competitive rodeo runs from\nspring through fall, while the modern professional rodeo circuit runs longer,\nand concludes with the PRCA National Finals Rodeo (NFR) in Las Vegas, Nevada,\nnow held in December.\n\nRodeo has provoked opposition from animal rights and animal welfare advocates,\nwho argue that various competitions constitute animal cruelty. The American\nrodeo industry has made progress in improving the welfare of rodeo animals,\nwith specific requirements for veterinary care and other regulations that\nprotect rodeo animals. However, rodeo is opposed by a number of animal welfare\norganizations in the United States and Canada. Some local and state\ngovernments in North America have banned or restricted rodeos, certain rodeo\nevents, or types of equipment. Internationally, rodeo is banned in the United\nKingdom and the Netherlands, [http://-\nwww.vancouverhumanesociety.bc.ca/campaigns/rodeos/ Rodeo: animal abuse for the\nsake of entertainment], Vancouver Humane Society, accessed April 2,\n2009. with other European nations placing restrictions on certain
