{"cursor":"13118","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Alcoholic fermentation', also referred to as 'ethanol fermentation', is a\nbiological process in which sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose are\nconverted into cellular energy and thereby produce ethanol and carbon dioxide as\nmetabolic waste products. Because yeasts perform this conversion in the absence\nof oxygen, alcoholic fermentation is considered an anaerobic process.\n\nAlcoholic fermentation occurs in the production of alcoholic beverages and\nethanol fuel, and in the rising of bread dough.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Ethanol_fermentation#Uses","recorded":1376428034,"links":[],"instances":["chemistry","alcohol","wine","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fermentation","Ethanol"],"headings":["Chemical process of fermentation of glucose","Effect of oxygen","Baking bread","Alcoholic beverages","Feedstocks for fuel production","Byproducts of fermentation","Microbes used in ethanol fermentation","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["mole","unit"],["dimer","chemistry"],["fermentation","wine"],["congener","alcohol"]],"members":["dimer","congener","fermentation","mole"],"related":["Glucose","Fructose","Sucrose","Adenosine_triphosphate","Ethanol","Carbon_dioxide","Yeast","Oxygen","Alcoholic_beverage","Ethanol_fuel","Bread","Dough","Chemical_equation","Mole_(unit)","Zymase","Dimer_(chemistry)","Invertase","Glycosidic_bond","Pyruvate","Glycolysis","Phosphate","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide","Adenosine_diphosphate","Adenosine_triphosphate","Substrate-level_phosphorylation","Glucose","Haworth_projection","Pyruvate","Acetaldehyde","Ethanol","Pyruvic_acid","Cellular_respiration","Aerobic_respiration","Alcoholic_beverage","Carbonic_maceration","Wine","Cider","Perry","Apple","Pear","Fruit_wine","Brandy","Eau_de_vie","Slivovitz","Distillation","Mead","Honey","Beer","Whiskey","Vodka","Amylase","Malting","Germination","Potato","Gin","Rice_wine","Sake","Rum","Sugarcane","Molasses","Cacha√ßa","Cane_juice","Gasoline","Sugarcane","Corn_ethanol","Sugar_beet","Distillers_grains","Sorghum","Pearl_millet","Duckweed","Grapes","Distillation","Wine","Sake","Mineral_oil","Cassava","Megajoule","Yeast","Zymomonas_mobilis","Anaerobic_respiration","Cellular_respiration","Cellulose","Fermentation_(wine)","Yeast_in_winemaking","Tryptophol","Tyrosol","Phenylethanol","Congener_(alcohol)"]}
