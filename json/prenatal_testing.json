{"cursor":"43615","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Prenatal diagnosis' or 'prenatal screening' (note that \"Prenatal Diagnosis\" and\n\"Prenatal Screening\" refer to two different types of tests) is testing for\ndiseases or conditions in a fetus or embryo before it is born. The aim is to\ndetect birth defects such as neural tube defects, Down syndrome, chromosome\nabnormalities, genetic diseases and other conditions, such as spina bifida,\ncleft palate, Tay Sachs disease, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, cystic\nfibrosis, Muscular dystrophy, and fragile X syndrome. Screening can also be used\nfor prenatal sex discernment. Common testing procedures include amniocentesis,\nultrasonography including nuchal translucency ultrasound, serum marker testing,\nor genetic screening. In some cases, the tests are administered to determine if\nthe fetus will be aborted, though physicians and patients also find it useful to\ndiagnose high-risk pregnancies early so that delivery can be scheduled in a\ntertiary care hospital where the baby can receive appropriate care.\n\nFetal screening has also been done to determine characteristics generally not\nconsidered birth defects, and avail for e.g. sex selection. The rise of designer\nbabies and parental selection for specific traits raises a host of bioethical\nand legal issues that are expected to dominate reproductive rights debates in\nthe 21st century.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"prenatal_testing","recorded":1376428440,"links":[],"instances":["tests","medical","medical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Obstetrical procedures","Tests during pregnancy|"],"headings":["Invasiveness","Fetal versus maternal","Reasons for prenatal diagnosis","Methods of prenatal screening and diagnosis","Advances in Prenatal Screening","Typical screening sequence","Conditions typically tested for","Ethical and practical issues","See also","Notes and references","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["invasive","medical"],["non-invasive","medical"],["sensitivity","tests"]],"members":["sensitivity","invasive"],"related":["Experiment","Fetus","Embryo","Birth_defect","Neural_tube_defect","Down_syndrome","Chromosome","Genetic_disease","Spina_bifida","Cleft_palate","Tay_Sachs_disease","Sickle_cell_anemia","Thalassemia","Cystic_fibrosis","Muscular_dystrophy","Fragile_X_syndrome","Prenatal_sex_discernment","Amniocentesis","Medical_ultrasonography","Nuchal_translucency","Abortion","Sex_selection","Designer_babies","Bioethics","Reproductive_rights","Invasive_(medical)","Non-invasive_(medical)","Uterus","Amniocentesis","Chorionic_villus_sampling","The_Cochrane_Collaboration","Transcervical","Relative_risk","Confidence_interval","Ultrasonography","Alpha-fetoprotein","Fetus","Adverse_effect","Pregnancy-associated_plasma_protein_A","Pre-eclampsia","Amniocentesis","Karyotype","Ultrasound","American_College_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynecologists","High_blood_pressure","Lupus_erythematosus","Diabetes","Asthma","Epilepsy","Cell-free_fetal_DNA","Aneuploidy","Baby_Gender_Mentor","Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis","In_vitro_fertilization","Human_embryo","Transvaginal_oocyte_retrieval","Uterus","Obstetric_ultrasonography","Twin","Nuchal_scan","Stethoscope","Non-stress_test","Cardiotocography","Transcervical","Trophoblast_cell","Cervical_mucus_aspiration","Cervical_swabbing","Cervical_lavage","Intrauterine_lavage","Prenatal_genetic_analysis","Fetal_sex_determination","Aneuploidies","Antibody_marker","Ectopic_pregnancy","Anembryonic_gestation","Human_chorionic_gonadotropin","Pregnancy-associated_plasma_protein_A","Alpha_fetoprotein","Chorionic_villus_sampling","Chorionic_villus","Amniocentesis","Amniotic_fluid","Amniocentesis","Cryopreserve","Amniotic_stem_cells","Embryoscopy","Fetoscopy","Percutaneous_umbilical_cord_blood_sampling","Human_chorionic_gonadotropin","Pregnancy-associated_plasma_protein_A","Blood_plasma","Nuchal_translucency","AFP_screening","Alpha_fetoprotein","Human_chorionic_gonadotropin","Inhibin","Estriol","Blood_plasma","Triple_test","Blood_serum","Alpha-fetoprotein","Estriol","Beta-hCG","Sensitivity_and_specificity","False-positive","Down_syndrome","Gestational_age","PAPP-A","Human_chorionic_gonadotropin","Vanishing_twin","Fetal_protein","Diagnosis_of_fetal_aneuploidy","Neural_tube_defects","Whole_blood","DNA_methylation","Nature_journal","Trisomy_21","Down_Syndrome","Massive_parallel_sequencing","Sensitivity_and_specificity","Gestational_age","Nuchal_scan","Nuchal_translucency","Nuchal_translucency","Aneuploidy","Down_Syndrome","Patau_Syndrome","Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization","Quantitative_PCR","Chorionic_villus_sampling","Nucleic_acid","Blood_plasma","Allele","Single_nucleotide_polymorphism","MRNA","Placenta","DNA_methylation","Trisomy","Trisomy_21","Trisomy_13","Trisomy_18","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Multiplex_ligation-dependent_probe_amplification","Shotgun_sequencing","Methylated_DNA","MicroRNA","RNA-sequencing","Smith-Lemli-Opitz_Syndrome","Fetal_intervention","Amniocentesis","Spina_bifida","Teratoma","Fetal_surgery","Wrongful_abortion","Cystic_fibrosis","Spina_bifida","Genetic_counselors","Spina_bifida","Echogenic_intracardiac_focus","Choroid_plexus_cyst","Chromosome","Type_I_and_type_II_errors","Type_I_and_type_II_errors","Medical_diagnosis","Alpha-fetoprotein","Acetylcholinesterase","Alpha-fetoprotein","Sensitivity_(tests)","Specific","Triple_test","HIV","Genetic_counselor","Genetic_counseling","Amniocentesis","Amniotic_stem_cell","Amniotic_stem_cell_bank","Chorionic_villi"]}
