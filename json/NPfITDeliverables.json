{"cursor":"39345","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'NHS Connecting for Health' is part of the UK Department of Health and was\nformed on 1 April 2004, replacing the former NHS Information Authority. It has\nthe responsibility of delivering the 'NHS National Programme for IT' (NPfIT), an\ninitiative by the Department of Health in England to move the National Health\nService (NHS) in England towards a single, centrally-mandated electronic care\nrecord for patients and to connect 30,000 General practitioners to 300\nhospitals, providing secure and audited access to these records by authorised\nhealth professionals.\n\nIt was planned that patients would also have access to their records online\nthrough a service called [https://www.healthspace.nhs.uk/ HealthSpace]. NPfIT is\nsaid by NHS CFH to be \"the world's biggest civil information technology\nprogramme\".\n\nThe cost of the programme, together with its ongoing problems of management and\nthe withdrawal or sacking of two of the four IT providers, have placed it at the\ncentre of ongoing controversy, and the Commons Public Accounts Committee has\nrepeatedly expressed serious concerns over its scope, planning, budgeting, and\npractical value to patients. {{Cite web\n| title = DoH: The NPfIT in the NHS - twentieth report of session 2006-2007\n| accessdate = 2008-05-31 url = http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm2006-\n| 07/cmselect/cmpubacc/390/390.pdf\n|format=PDF}} As of January\n2009, while some systems were being deployed across the NHS, other key\ncomponents of the system were estimated to be four years behind schedule, and\nothers had yet to be deployed outside individual trusts at all.\n\nWhile the Daily Mail announced on 22 September 2011 that \"Â£12bn NHS computer\nsystem is scrapped...\", The Guardian noted that the announcement from\nthe Department of Health on 9 September, had been \"part of a process\ntowards localising NHS IT that has been under way for several years\".\nWhilst remaining aspects of the National Programme for IT were cancelled, most\nof the spending would proceed with the Department of Health seeking for local\nsoftware solutions rather than a single nationally imposed system.\n","linknr":437,"url":"NPfIT#Deliverables","recorded":1376421073,"links":["/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Connecting_for_Health","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=NPfIT&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","/wiki/NHSnet","/wiki/Wikipedia:Merging","/wiki/Talk:NHS_Connecting_for_Health","/wiki/Department_of_Health_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/National_Health_Service_(England)","/wiki/General_practitioner","https://www.healthspace.nhs.uk/","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee_(United_Kingdom)","#cite_note-Telegraph_070417-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-Public_Accounts_2009-4","#cite_note-Public_Accounts_2009-4","/wiki/Daily_Mail","#cite_note-5","/wiki/The_Guardian","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#Structure_and_scope_of_the_programme","#Reviews","#Costs","#Deliverables","#The_Spine_.28including_PDS_.26_PSIS.29","#Exceptions","#Clusters_and_Local_Service_Providers","#Local_ownership","#National_Application_Service_Providers","#Changes_to_service_providers","#Criticisms_of_the_programme","#Failure_to_deliver_clinical_benefits","#Data_security_risks","#Reservations_of_medical_staff","#Impact_on_IT_providers","#Implementation","#Management_team","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_note-9","/wiki/NHS_Information_Authority","/wiki/Leeds","/wiki/NHS_strategic_health_authorities","#cite_note-Public_Accounts_2009-4","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/MPs","#cite_note-Signatories-10","/wiki/Health_Select_Committee","#cite_note-CW20060412a-11","#cite_note-CW20060411b-12","#cite_note-CW20061010a-13","/wiki/King%27s_Fund","#cite_note-Wanless_2007-14","#cite_note-15","/wiki/McKinsey_%26_Company","#cite_note-16","#cite_note-CompWeekly-17","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&veaction=edit&section=3","/wiki/Pound_sterling","/wiki/National_Audit_Office_(United_Kingdom)","#cite_note-NAO_2006-18","#cite_note-BCS_2006-19","/wiki/Cost_overrun","#cite_note-20","/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/British_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Edward_Leigh","#cite_note-Telegraph_070417-2","/wiki/Richard_Granger","#cite_note-Kablenet-21","#cite_note-Observer-22","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&veaction=edit&section=4","#cite_note-Wanless_2007-14","#cite_note-Public_Accounts_2009-4","/wiki/NHS_Care_Records_Service","/wiki/NHS_Electronic_Prescription_Service","/wiki/Choose_and_Book","/wiki/N3_(NHS)","/wiki/Picture_Archiving_and_Communication_System","/wiki/Quality_Management_and_Analysis_System","/wiki/NHSmail","#cite_note-23","#cite_note-24","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&veaction=edit&section=5","/wiki/Summary_Care_Record","/wiki/Sunday_Times","#cite_note-25","#cite_note-CompWeekly-17","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&veaction=edit&section=6","/wiki/Wales","/wiki/Informing_Healthcare","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&action=edit&section=7","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&veaction=edit&section=7","/wiki/England","/wiki/Accenture","/wiki/Fujitsu","http://www.cscalliance.com","http://www.btplc.com/health/","http://www.accenture.com","http://www.cscalliance.com","/wiki/Picture_archiving_and_communication_system","http://uk.fujitsu.com","#cite_note-Guardian_080529-26","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&action=edit&section=8","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Connecting_for_Health&veaction=edit
