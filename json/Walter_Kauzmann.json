Kauzmann' (18 August 1916 â 27 January 2009) was an American chemist\nand professor emeritus of Princeton University. He was noted for his work in\nboth physical chemistry and biochemistry. His most important contribution was\nrecognizing that the hydrophobic effect plays a key role in determining the three-\ndimensional structure of proteins. Walter\nKauzmann, Some Factors in the Interpretation of Protein Denaturation, Advances\nin Protein Chemistry (1959) Vol. 14, pgs 1â63. He is also well known for\nan insight into the nature of supercooled liquids which is now known as\nKauzmann's paradox. [Walter Kauzmann, The Nature\nof the Glassy State and the Behavior of Liquids at Low Temperatures, Chemical\nReviews (1948), Vol 43, pg. 219.] At Princeton, Kauzmann was the David B.\nJones Professor Emeritus of Chemistry. He chaired the Department of Chemistry\n(1964 to 1968) and the Department of Biochemical Sciences (1980 to 1981).\n\nHe was born in Mount Vernon, New York and grew up in New Rochelle, New York. He\nwas the son of the German-born Albert F. Kauzmann, who came to the United States\nin 1895, and Julia (Kahle) Kauzmann. Albert operated a gem-importing business in\nLower Manhattan and would often bring his son to work on Saturday mornings. They\nwould spend the afternoon at the American Museum of Natural History or attend a\nmatinee at the Metropolitan Opera, nurturing Walter's lifelong love of science\nand music.\n\nKauzmann earned a B.A. degree in 1937 from Cornell University, which he attended\non a full scholarship. He started his doctoral work at Princeton University in\norganic chemistry, but switched to physical chemistry, earning a Ph.D. in 1940\nunder the direction of Henry Eyring. Following his Ph.D., Kauzmann had a two-\nyear postdoctoral appointment in Pittsburgh as a Westinghouse Research Fellow,\nin the laboratory led by Edward U. Condon. It was during this period that\nKauzmann wrote his now classic paper on supercooled liquids and glasses that\ncontained the Kauzmann paradox. At the end of\nthis fellowship, with the U.S. fighting WWII, Kauzmann joined the U.S.\ngovernment's National Defense Research Council laboratory in Bruceton,\nPennsylvania, which was directed by George Kistiakowsky, and worked on chemical\nexplosives.\n\nIn 1944, Kauzmann was recruited into the top secret Manhattan Project and he\nmoved to Los Alamos, New Mexico. Eventually, Kauzmann was put in charge of\nproducing the detonator for the Trinity test, which was the first detonation of\nan atomic bomb, and of the (Fat Man) plutonium bomb that was dropped on\nNagasaki, Japan. Kauzmann witnessed the Trinity test on July 16, 1945, and his\nmemories were recorded in a newspaper\narticle. [http://www.capitalcentury.com/1944.html Jon Blackwell, 1944: Brain\npower into nuclear power, The Trentonian] Fifty years later, Kauzmann\ndiscussed why he worked on the atomic bomb:\n\n\"But there was another, even stronger reason that many of us felt justified our\nworking as hard as we could on the bomb. It was felt that if it were possible to\nmake atomic bombs, somewhere, someday, someone would figure out how to do it and\nsome country would proceed to make them. If this were done after World War II\nwas over, the bomb would very likely be made as a secret weapon. This would\ninevitably lead to World War III. Therefore, there were strong reasons for\ntrying to make the bomb - and use it - before the end of World War II. The\npeople of the world would then know the terrible thing that could be unleashed\nif there were a World War III. And the politicians could then be encouraged to\ntry to do something about preventing World War III.\" Walter Kauzmannâs [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-\nbin/fulltext/121599163/PDFSTART Reminiscences from a life in protein physical\nchemistry], Protein Science (1993) Vol 2, pgs 671-691.\n\nIn 1946, Kauzmann returned to Princeton as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry\nand remained on the Princeton Faculty throughout his long academic career. His\nwork was centered in the area of biophysical chemistry, particularly the studies\nof the structure and thermodynamics of proteins. His insight that hydrophobic\ninteractions play a key role in stabilizing protein structure was made before\nX-ray crystallography provided the first three-dimensional structures of\nproteins. Kauzmann's model, that proteins\nfold to bury hydrophobic residues and to expose hydrophilic ones, has stood the\ntest of time Tanford, C. & Reynolds, J. Nature's Robots: A History of\nProteins Ch. 12 (Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford, 2001 and is one of the key\nprinciples of de novo protein structure prediction. Kauzmann became an emeritus\nprofessor in 1982.\n\nHis first book, Quantum Chemistry, was published in 1957, followed by The\nKinetic Theory of Gases (1966) and Thermodynamics and Statistics (1967). With\nDavid Eisenberg, a former postdoctoral fellow of Kauzmann, he wrote The\nStructure and Properties of Water (1969), a book reissued in 2005 by Oxford\nUniversity Press as part of its Classic Texts in the Physical Sciences series.\nThe first three are textbooks for undergraduate physical chemistry, which\nKauzmann taught at Princeton for many years. Kauzmann's pedagogy is discussed in\nan article by Bruce Alberts. Bruce Alberts, Walter Kauzmannâs contribution\nto the future of science: a personal recollection, Biophysical Chemistry (2003)\nVol. 105, pgs. 175-177.\n\nKauzmann married Elizabeth Flagler Kauzmann, then a research assistant in the\nlaboratory of Frank Johnson in the Princeton Biology Department, in April, 1951.\nElizabeth died in 2004 after more than 50 years of marriage. They are survived\nby two sons, a daughter, and eight grandchildren. They summered on Cape Breton\nIsland, and eventually donated of their property to the Nova Scotia Nature\nTrust.
