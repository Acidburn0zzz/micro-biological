{"cursor":"35460","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Dominance}} 'Dominance' in genetics is a relationship between alleles of a\nsingle gene, in which one allele masks the phenotypic expression of another\nallele at the same gene locus.  In the simplest case, where a gene\nexists in two allelic versions (designated A and B), three combinations of\nalleles (genotypes) are possible: AA, AB, and BB. If AA and BB individuals\n(homozygotes) show different forms of some trait (phenotypes), and AB\nindividuals (heterozygotes) show the same phenotype as AA individuals, then\nallele A is said to dominate or be dominant to or show dominance to allele B,\nand B is said to be recessive to A. If instead AB has the same phenotype as BB,\nB is said to be dominant to A. Dominance should be distinguished from epistasis,\na relationship in which an allele of one gene affects the expression of an\nallele at a different gene.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"dominance_relationship","recorded":1376418407,"links":[],"instances":["cat","biology","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical genetics"],"headings":["Background","Nomenclature","Relationship to other genetic concepts","Molecular mechanisms","Dominant and recessive genetic diseases in humans","Dominant-negative mutations","History","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["locus","genetics"],["locus","genetics"],["locus","genetics"],["siamese","cat"],["siamese","cat"],["transcription","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["hybrid","biology"]],"members":["siamese","hybrid","transcription","locus"],"related":["Genetics","Alleles","Gene","Allele","Phenotype","Allele","Gene","Locus_(genetics)","Genotypes","Zygosity","Phenotype","Zygosity","Epistasis","Allele","Gene","Chromosome","Ploidy","Ovum","Sperm","Fertilization","Ploidy","Gametes","Meiosis","Locus_(genetics)","Genes","Allele","DNA","Homozygote","Heterozygote","Genotype","Phenotype","Gregor_Mendel","Locus_(genetics)","Siamese_(cat)","Albinism","Birman","Siamese_(cat)","Albinism","Four_o'clock_flower","HBB","Hemoglobin","Protein_electrophoresis","Transcription_(genetics)","RNA","Mammal","Sex-determination_system","X_chromosome","Y_chromosome","Autosome","Sex_linkage","Zygosity","Testis_determining_factor","Epistasis","Nucleobase","Nucleotide","DNA","Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology","Transcription_(genetics)","Translation","Protein_isoform","Enzyme","Allozyme","Mutation","Albinism","Melanin","HBB","Globin","Hemoglobin","Red_blood_cells","Anemia","Sickle-cell_anemia","Sickle-cell_trait","Trinucleotide_repeat","Huntington_Disease","Phenylketonuria","Phenylalanine_hydroxylase","Phenylalanine","Central_nervous_system","Mental_retardation","Hyperphenylalaninemia","Apoptosis","Ataxia_telangiectasia_mutated","CEBPA","Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor_gamma","Gregor_Mendel","Hybrid_(biology)","Recessive_trait","Evolution_of_dominance","List_of_Mendelian_traits_in_humans","Mitochondrial_DNA","Sex_linkage","Huntington's_Disease_Outreach_Project_for_Education_at_Stanford"]}
