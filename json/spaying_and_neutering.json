{"cursor":"42348","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", Scene of a cat castration, 1531â32, Castello del Buonconsiglio, Trento]]\n'Neutering', from the Latin neuter (of neither sex [http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-\nbin/lookup.pl?stem=neuter&ending= University of Notre Dame online Latin\ndictionary] ), is the removal of an animal's reproductive organ, either all\nof it or a considerably large part. The term is often used in reference to males\nwhereas 'spaying' is often reserved for females. Colloquially, both terms are\noften referred to as 'fixing'. While technically called [[castration]] for\nmales, in male horses, the process is referred to as [[gelding]].\n\nNeutering is the most common sterilizing method in animals. In the United\nStates, most humane societies, animal shelters and rescue groups urge pet owners\nto have their pets spayed or neutered to prevent the births of unwanted litters,\ncontributing to the overpopulation of unwanted animals in the rescue system.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"spaying_and_neutering","recorded":1376428054,"links":[],"instances":["surgical_procedure","abdomen","canine","animals","castrated_cattle","chemistry","animal","animal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Castration","Veterinary castration","Dog health","Surgical removal procedures","Cat health","Animal welfare","Ferrets","Veterinary medicine"],"headings":["Health and behavioral effects","Methods","Nonsurgical alternatives","Surgical alternatives","Early-age neutering","Other issues surrounding the debate","Terminology for neutered animals","Religious views on neutering","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["sterilization","surgical_procedure"],["litter","animal"],["overpopulation","animals"],["hip_dysplasia","canine"],["bladder_stone","animal"],["linea_alba","abdomen"],["analog","chemistry"],["stag","castrated_cattle"]],"members":["sterilization","linea_alba","hip_dysplasia","overpopulation","stag","analog","litter","bladder_stone"],"related":["Castello_del_Buonconsiglio","Trento","Latin","Reproductive_organ","Sterilization_(surgical_procedure)","United_States","Humane_society","Animal_shelter","Rescue_group","Litter_(animal)","Overpopulation_(animals)","Sexual_dimorphism","Sexual_intercourse","Urine_spraying","Aggression","Mammary_tumor","Female_dogs","Metrorrhagia","False_pregnancy","Pyometra","Endometrial_cancer","Ovarian_cancer","Testicular_cancer","Veterinary_anesthesia","Veterinary_surgery","Obesity","Osteosarcoma","Hemangiosarcoma","Alopecia","Golden_retrievers","Lymphosarcoma","Hip_dysplasia_(canine)","Male_dogs","Prostate_cancer","Bouvier_des_Flandres","Feline_lower_urinary_tract_disease","Bladder_stone_(animal)","Urethra","Urinary_incontinence","Hypothyroidism","Ovary","Uterus","Oophorectomy","Cat","Dog","Livestock","Mare","Open_surgery","Laparoscopic_surgery","Navel","Suture_material","Cervix","Linea_alba_(abdomen)","Navel","Progesterone","Hormone","Serotonin","Testes","Calcium_chloride","Ethanol","Necrosis","Neutersol","Cytotoxic","Adjudin","Analog_(chemistry)","Seminiferous_tubules","Sertoli_cell","Spermatogonium","Spermatogenesis","Piezoelectricity","Polymer","Seminal_fluid","Vas_deferens","Epididymis","Female_mammals","Porcine_zona_pellucida","Female_mammal","Zona_Pellucida","Male_mammals","Female_mammals","Vas_deferens","Ferrets","Sheep","Sex_hormone","Sexually_transmitted_disease","American_Veterinary_Medical_Association","American_Animal_Hospital_Association","Cranial_cruciate_ligament","Cystitis","Canine_parvovirus","Feline_asthma","Urine_spraying","Sterilization","Dog","Cat","Ferret","Cattle","Ox","Stag_(castrated_cattle)","Chicken","Capon","Deer","Goat","Horse","Donkey","Gelding","Pig","Rabbit","Sheep","Animal_husbandry","Animal_fancy","Chicken","Ferret","Madh'hab","Islam","Maslaha","Orthodox_Judaism","Sephardi_Jews","Chief_Rabbi","Israel","Shlomo_Amar","AB_1634","Animal_population_control","Animal_shelter","Forced_sterilization","Hysterectomy","Oophorectomy","Overpopulation_in_companion_animals","Spay_Day_USA"]}
