It is an ester formed from the omega-6 fatty acid\narachidonic acid and glycerol. It is present at relatively high levels in the\ncentral nervous system, with cannabinoid neuromodulatory effects. It has been\nfound in maternal bovine and human milk. The chemical was first described in 1994-\n1995, although had been discovered some time before that. The activities of\nPhospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) mediate its formation.\n2-AG is synthesized from arachidonic acid-containing diacylglycerol (DAG).\n","linknr":-1,"url":"2-arachidonoylglycerol","recorded":1376428523,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cannabinoids","Neurotransmitters","Fatty acid esters","CB1 receptor agonist"],"headings":["Occurrence","Discovery","Pharmacology","Biosynthesis","2-AG, lack of sleep, and subsequent tendency to overeat","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Endocannabinoid","Endogenous","Agonist","CB1_receptor","Ester","Omega-6_fatty_acid","Arachidonic_acid","Glycerol","Phospholipase_C","Diacylglycerol_lipase","Biosynthesis","Arachidonic_acid","Diglyceride","Anandamide","Endocannabinoid","Teikyo_University","Raphael_Mechoulam","Hebrew_University_of_Jerusalem","Anandamide","Endocannabinoid","Nervous_system","Georgetown,_Texas","Anandamide","Phospholipase_C","Diacylglycerol_lipase","NG108-15","Neuroblastoma","Monoacylglycerol_lipase","Fatty_acid_amide_hydrolase","Serine_hydrolase","ABHD6","ABHD12","National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","Biosynthesis","Arachidonic_acid","Diglyceride","Lipid_signaling","Metabolism","Diacylglycerol_lipase","Hydrolysis","Diglyceride","Phosphatidylcholine","Phosphatidic_acid","Lysophosphatidic_acid","Phosphatase","University_of_Chicago","Medicine","Biological_Sciences","Erin_Hanlon","Ph.D.","Research_Associate","University_of_Chicago_Pritzker_School_of_Medicine","Endocrinology","Diabetes","Metabolism","Preliminary_results","Annual_Meeting","The_Endocrine_Society","Huffington_Post","Sleep_restriction","Hunger","Appetite","Overeating_after_inadequate_sleep","Endocannabinoid","Molecule","2-AG","Sleep_deprivation","Insulin_resistance","Genetic_changes_in_children","Loneliness","2-Arachidonoyl_glyceryl_ether"]}
