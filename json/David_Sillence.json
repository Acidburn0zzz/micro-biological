An honours graduate of the University of Sydney, he\nobtained his MD in Medical Genetics from the University of Melbourne 1978 in\nBone Dysplasias.\n\nDavid Sillence was a founding member of the Human Genetics Society of\nAustralasia (1978), the Australian Teratology Society (1981), the Australian\nFaculty of Public Health Medicine (1990), and the American College of Medical\nGenetics (1993) and has held office in the Human Genetics Society of Australasia\nfrom 1981 to 2000, often with more than one concurrent position. He has also\nheld office in the Royal Australasian College of Physicians from 1994 to 2000.\nHe has been a member of many committees within the School of Public Health and\nTropical Medicine, and the University of Sydney. He currently serves on the\neducation committee of the Human Genetics Society of Australasia, the\nInternational Nomenclature Committee for Constitutional Disorders of the\nSkeletal, the International Mucopolysaccharidosis type I expert committee, the\nNational Fabry Disease and MPS expert committees for the LSDP.\n\nDavid Sillence was instrumental in establishing the first working party to write\nguidelines for training in Clinical Genetics in Australia and was granted\nClinical Geneticist status (1987) through the grandfather clause. This\ncertification model has been used by other Special Interest Groups within the\nHuman Genetics Society of Australasia. He has been involved in a considerable\namount of collaborative research as well as those within his department. He has\npublished over 130 original articles, has contributed over 30 book chapters, 8\nbooks/monographs, and has contributed to conference proceedings more than a\ndozen times. He has been a peer reviewer/editor to 8 different groups/journals.\n(http://en.scientificcommons.org/david_sillence,\nhttp://www.biomedexperts.com/Profile.bme/1308498/David_Sillence )\n\nDavid Sillence has obtained scholarships and awards throughout his career: a\nBursary and Scholarship to attend the University of Sydney, a vacation\nfellowship, Honours at Graduation, Research Fellowship, Travelling Fellowship,\nand Fulbright Fellowship. He has been outstanding in his efforts to obtain\ngrants from charitable foundations, societies, commercial entities and NH&MRC.\nAll these grants have been used to further the worldwide knowledge in genetics\nand especially Osteogenesis Imperfecta.\n\nDavid Sillence has been a member of non-institutional committees, such as the\nBirth Defects Registers Sub-Committee and Genetics Services Advisory Committee.\nIt was through his vision and that a five-year plan (1993â1998) for the\nprovision of Genetic Services in NSW was written, became policy and was\nimplemented. This has led to the establishment of the current Clinical Genetics\nnetwork throughout the state of NSW.\n\nDavid Sillence has served on the boards, Medical and Scientific Advisory\nCommittees of OI Society, Association of Persons with Short Stature,\nMucopolysaccharidosis Society of Australia, Huntington Disease Association of\nNSW and Association of Genetic Support of Australasia.\n\nDavid Sillence created the first classification system for Osteogenesis\nImperfecta that he later developed further to be the world standard. It enabled\nprogress into the molecular causes of the disorder and collagen mutations.\n(Sillence DO, Senn A, Danks DM (1979). \"Genetic heterogeneity in osteogenesis\nimperfecta\". J. Med. Genet. 16 (2): 101â16. . PMID 458828.)\n\nDavid Sillenceâs current research interests include a) Genetics and treatment of\nosteopenic and other metabolic bone disorders of childhood, b) Characterization\nof the molecular genetics and pathogenesis of specific skeletal birth defects in\nmouse and man, c) Consanguinity and paediatric morbidity/population genetics of\nconsanguinity in Middle Eastern Populations, d) Evaluation of Innovative Genetic\nTherapies. Previous studies in the genetics and treatment of osteopenic and\nother metabolic bone disorders has led to the development of i) Normal range of\nbone density and skeletal metabolites in children, ii) a delineation of the\nnatural history of various skeletal disorders collectively known as Osteogenesis\nImperfecta and iii) the definition of the specific conditions for treatment of\nthese disorders with Bisphosphonates.\n\nDavid Sillence also formed the centre for the evaluation of Innovative Genetic\nTherapies at the Westmead Hospital and the Childrenâs Hospital at Westmead to\nevaluate innovative therapies such as Enzyme replacement and Substrate Reduction\nTherapies in the treatment of Lysosomal storage disorders in Adults and\nChildren.(Mellor, L. 150 Years, 150 Firsts: The People of the Faculty of\nMedicine (2006) Sydney, Sydney University Press)\n\nIn 2012, David delivered the Human Genetics Society of Australasia Oration, a\nprestigious lecture given by a senior member of the HGSA who has contributed\nsignificantly to the discipline over many years. https://www.hgsa.org.au/website/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/hgsa-\nhistory.pdf David was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the\n2013 Australia Day Honours.\n","linknr":143,"url":"David_Sillence","recorded":1376425875,"links":["/w/index.php?title=David_Sillence&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=David_Sillence&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sillence","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources","/wiki/Defamation","/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia","/wiki/Medical_Genetics","/wiki/University_of_Sydney","/wiki/University_of_Melbourne","/w/index.php?title=Bone_Dysplasia&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Human_Genetics_Society_of_Australasia&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Australian_Teratology_Society&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Australian_Faculty_of_Public_Health_Medicine&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/American_College_of_Medical_Genetics","/wiki/Royal_Australasian_College_of_Physicians","/w/index.php?title=School_of_Public_Health_and_Tropical_Medicine&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=International_Nomenclature_Committee&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Mucopolysaccharidosis","/w/index.php?title=Expert_committee&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Fabry_disease","/w/index.php?title=Working_party&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Clinical_Genetics","/wiki/Grandfather_clause","/w/index.php?title=Certification_model&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Special_Interest_Group","/wiki/Monograph","/w/index.php?title=Peer_reviewer&action=edit&redlink=1","http://en.scientificcommons.org/david_sillence","http://www.biomedexperts.com/Profile.bme/1308498/David_Sillence","/w/index.php?title=Vacation_fellowship&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Research_Fellowship&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Travelling_Fellowship&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Fulbright_Fellowship","/wiki/Charitable_foundation","/wiki/Osteogenesis_Imperfecta","/w/index.php?title=Birth_Defects_Registers_Sub-Committee&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Genetics_Services_Advisory_Committee&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=OI_Society&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Association_of_Persons_with_Short_Stature&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Mucopolysaccharidosis_Society_of_Australia&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Huntington_Disease_Association_of_NSW&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Association_of_Genetic_Support_of_Australasia&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136%2Fjmg.16.2.101","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/458828?dopt=Abstract","/w/index.php?title=Metabolic_bone_disorder&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Molecular_genetics","/wiki/Pathogenesis","/wiki/Birth_defect","/wiki/Consanguinity","/w/index.php?title=Paediatric_morbidity&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Population_genetics","/wiki/Bone_density","/wiki/Skeletal_disorder","/wiki/Bisphosphonate","/wiki/Westmead_Hospital","/wiki/Enzyme_replacement","/wiki/Lysosomal_storage_disorder","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Order_of_Australia","/w/index.php?title=David_Sillence&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=David_Sillence&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","https://www.hgsa.org.au/website/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/hgsa-history.pdf","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Sillence&oldid=556833536","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Australian_geneticists","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:University_of_Sydney_alumni","/wiki/Category:University_of_Sydney_faculty","/wiki/Category:University_of_Melbourne_alumni","/wiki/Category:BLP_articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2010","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_missing_(living_people)","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=David+Sillence&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=David+Sillence","/wiki/David_Sillence","/wiki/Talk:David_Sillence","#","/wiki/David_Sillence","/w/index.php?
