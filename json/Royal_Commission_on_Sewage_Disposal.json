The Commission had established a piece of practical\nresearch into this problem and reported on its outcome. *The seventh report\ndealt with the proliferation of green seaweed in polluted estuaries and in\nparticular Belfast Lough. *The eight report dealt with the standards that should\napply to sewage discharges to rivers and tidal waters and specified\nconcentrations of constituents that should not be exceeded. *The ninth report\nmade similar recommendations with regard to manufacturing waste by type. Also\nwithin this report further recommendations were made including provisions for\ngiving powers of entry, general changes to the law and for the discharge of\nwaste waters from mines. *The 10th and final report in 1912 summarised the\nfindings of the previous made proposals for the establishment of River Boards\nacross England and Wales to complement the three already in existence.\n\nThe findings of the commission were to be used to enact legislation to control\nsewage and manufacturing pollution of water that continued in force up until the\nenactment of the Water Act 1974. It was the eighth report of the commission that\nestablished the 30:20 standard for sewage effluent that remained the most widely\nused standard in many parts of the world up till the present.\n","linknr":105,"url":"Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal","recorded":1376416638,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Government","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Queen_Victoria","/wiki/Edward_VII","/wiki/King_George_V","/wiki/Local_Authority","/wiki/Manufacturer","/wiki/Water_pollution","/wiki/Sewage_treatment","/wiki/Brewery","/wiki/Seaweed","/wiki/Belfast_Lough","/w/index.php?title=Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924003641929#page/n1/mode/2up","/wiki/File:Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_(HM_Government).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg/45px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal&action=edit","/wiki/Template:UK-gov-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:UK-gov-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK-gov-stub&action=edit","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Terra.png/25px-Terra.png","/wiki/Natural_environment","/wiki/Government_agency","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Environmental-agency-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Environmental-agency-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Environmental-agency-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal&oldid=548406965","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Statutory_law","/wiki/Category:Environmental_agencies_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:1898_establishments_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:British_royal_commissions","/wiki/Category:Defunct_environmental_agencies","/wiki/Category:United_Kingdom_government_stubs","/wiki/Category:Environmental_agency_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Royal+Commission+on+Sewage+Disposal&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Royal+Commission+on+Sewage+Disposal","/wiki/Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal","/w/index.php?title=Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal&oldid=548406965","/w/index.php?title=Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7374034","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal&id=548406965","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Royal+Commission+on+Sewage+Disposal","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Royal+Commission+on+Sewage+Disposal&oldid=548406965&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7374034#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/T
