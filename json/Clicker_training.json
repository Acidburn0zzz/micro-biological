The clicker is\nused during the acquisition phase of training a new behavior, to allow the\nanimal to rapidly identify the precise behavior of interest.\n\nClicker training originated with Marian Bailey (nÃ©e Kruse) and Keller Breland,\nwho as graduate students of psychologist and eminent behaviorist B.F. Skinner\ntaught wild-caught pigeons to \"bowl\" (push a ball with their beaks) during\nmilitary research. Peterson, G. (2000). The Discovery of Shaping or B.F.\nSkinnerâs Big Surprise. The Clicker Journal: The Magazine for Animal Trainers,\n43, 6-13. According to their work, animal training was being needlessly\nhindered because traditional methods of praise and reward did not inform the\nanimal of success with enough promptness and precision to create the required\ncognitive connections for speedy learning. Similar methods were later used in\ntraining at least 140 species including whales, bears, lions, chickens and\ndomestic dogs and cats, and even humans (TAGteach).
