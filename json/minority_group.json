{"cursor":"20273","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'minority group' is a sociological category within a demographic. Rather than\na relational \"social group\", as the term would indicate, the term refers to a\ncategory that is differentiated and defined by the social majority, that is,\nthose who hold the majority of positions of social power in a society. The\ndifferentiation can be based on one or more observable human characteristics,\nincluding, for example, ethnicity, race, gender, wealth, health or sexual\norientation. Usage of the term is applied to various situations and\ncivilizations within history, despite its popular mis-association with a\nnumerical, statistical minority. In the social sciences, the term \"minority\" is\nused to refer to categories of persons who hold few positions of social power.\n\nThe term \"minority group\" often occurs alongside a discourse of civil rights and\ncollective rights which gained prominence in the 20th century. Members of\nminority groups are prone to different treatment in the countries and societies\nin which they live. This discrimination may be directly based on an individual's\nperceived membership of a minority group, without consideration of that\nindividual's personal achievement. It may also occur indirectly, due to social\nstructures that are not equally accessible to all. Activists campaigning on a\nrange of issues may use the language of minority rights, including student\nrights, consumer rights and animal rights.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"minority_group","recorded":1376428437,"links":[],"instances":["social","sociology","romani_subgroup","law","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Voting theory","Minorities|*","Human rights","Disability rights","Women's rights","Linguistic rights","Youth rights","Majority–minority relations"],"headings":["Definition","Sociology of minority groups","Minorities in law and government","Affirmative action","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["differentiation","sociology"],["power","philosophy"],["norm","social"],["minor","law"],["race","u.s._census"],["roma","romani_subgroup"]],"members":["norm","differentiation","roma","race","minor","power"],"related":["Social_group","Categorization","Differentiation_(sociology)","Power_(philosophy)","Social_sciences","Civil_rights","Collective_rights","Discrimination","Activist","Minority_rights","Student_rights","Consumer_rights","Animal_rights","University_of_Michigan_Press","Racial_and_Ethnic_Relations","Prentice-Hall","United_States","Historically_excluded_group","Louis_Wirth","Society","Ascribed_status","Social_solidarity","Abkhazia","Society","Ethnic_minority","Linguistic_minority","South_Africa_under_apartheid","Human_migration","Indigenous_peoples","Nomad","European_Charter_for_Regional_or_Minority_Languages","Framework_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_National_Minorities","Daniel_Šmihula","International_criminal_law","Lyal_Sunga","Self-determination","Daniel_Šmihula","Lesbian","Gay","Bisexuality","Transgender","LGBT","Queer","Norm_(social)","Gay_Liberation","Women","Feminist","Women's_Rights","Gender_variance","Intersex","Transsexuality","Metrosexual","Religious_minorities","Atheism","Agnosticism","Egypt","Islam","Christianity","Judaism","Egyptian_identification_card_controversy","Atheism","Gerontocracy","Adultism","Ageism","International_human_rights_instruments","Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child","Children's_rights_movement","Youth_rights","Minor_(law)","Senior_citizen","Help_the_Aged","Gray_Panthers","Disability_rights_movement","Autism","Neurodiversity","Racism","Deaf_community","Deaf","Politics","Country","Ethnic_group","Minority_language","Canada","China","Ethiopia","Germany","India","Netherlands","Poland","Romania","Russia","Croatia","United_Kingdom","United_States","Race_(U.S._Census)","Spain","Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","Constitution","Nation","Nations_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","Roma_(Romani_subgroup)","Jews","Nation-state","Separatism","Supremacist","Canada","English_language","French_Canadians","Quebec_separatism","Bilingual_education","Affirmative_action","Dominant_minority","Ethnic_elite","Ethnic_group","Ethnic_minorities_in_Northern_Ireland","Intangible_Cultural_Heritage","Interminority_racism","Linguistic_minority","List_of_minority_political_parties","Majority","Marginalization","Middleman_Minority","Minority_influence","Minority_religion","Minority_rights","Minority_Rights_Group_International","Model_minority","Social_exclusion","Social_stratification"]}
