{"cursor":"4569","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\"'Non-Darwinian Evolution'\" is a 1969 scientific paper co-authored by Jack\nLester King and Thomas H. Jukes that is credited, along with Motoo Kimura's 1968\npaper \"Evolutionary Rate at the Molecular Level\", with proposing what became\nknown as the neutral theory of molecular evolution. The paper brings together a\nwide variety of evidence, ranging from protein sequence comparisons to studies\nof the Treffers mutator gene in [[E. coli]] to analysis of the genetic code to\ncomparative immunology, to argue that most protein evolution is due to neutral\nmutations and genetic drift. It was published in the May 16, 1969 issue of\n[[Science (journal)|Science]].\n\nThe idea of evolution at the molecular level being driven by the random\nprocesses of mutation and genetic drift, largely independent from natural\nselection, was controversial at the time; the provocative title further\nemphasized the break with mainstream evolutionary thought, which was dominated\nby the synthetic theory of evolution, often referred to as \"Neo-Darwinism\".\nAlthough they argued for essentially the same conclusion as Motoo Kimura's\nearlier paper, King and Jukes criticized one of Kimura's central arguments, an\nestimate of the rate of amino acid change in proteins that according to Kimura\nwould indicate an impossibly high genetic load if the changes were caused by\nnatural selection. The paper was initially rejected by its reviewers (one\nthought it was trivial and the other thought it was totally wrong ), but was\npublished after an appeal. This time, the reviewer is James F. Crow, Motoo\nKimura's collaborator. Despite the intentionally inflammatory title and\n\"antiauthoritarian tone\"—which according to historian Michael R. Dietrich\n\"undoubtedly struck a nerve\", especially since King and Jukes worked at UC\nBerkeley during that period of political unrest—the paper acknowledges the\nsignificance of natural selection; it merely argues against panselectionism (as\nadvocated at the molecular level by G. G. Simpson and Emil L. Smith in\nparticular). From 1969 until the early 1970s, the concept of neutral mutations\ndriven to fixation by genetic drift was known as \"Non-Darwinian Evolution\"; it\nwas subsequently termed the \"neutral theory of molecular evolution\".\n\n\"Non-Darwinian Evolution\" generated considerable interest in neutral mutations,\nand became very influential in the field of molecular evolution. The response by\ncritics (including direct rebuttals by Bryan Clarke and Rollin\nRichmond ), and subsequent replies (by King and Jukes, Kimura, and\nothers) marked the beginning of the neutralist/selectionist controversy. In the\n1970s and 1980s, Kimura became the chief advocate of the neutral theory, but he\nadopted a number of King and Jukes' arguments and de-emphasized genetic\nload.\n","linknr":143,"url":"Non-Darwinian_Adaptation","recorded":1376419297,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Non-Darwinian_Evolution&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Non-Darwinian_Evolution&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Darwinian_Evolution","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Non-Darwinian_Adaptation&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Jack_Lester_King","/wiki/Thomas_H._Jukes","/wiki/Motoo_Kimura","/w/index.php?title=Evolutionary_Rate_at_the_Molecular_Level&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","/wiki/Protein_sequence","/w/index.php?title=Treffers_mutator_gene&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/E._coli","/w/index.php?title=Comparative_immunology&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Neutral_mutation","/wiki/Genetic_drift","/wiki/Science_(journal)","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Natural_selection","/wiki/Synthetic_theory_of_evolution","/wiki/Neo-Darwinism","/wiki/Genetic_load","/wiki/UC_Berkeley","/wiki/Panselectionism","/wiki/G._G._Simpson","/wiki/Emil_L._Smith","/wiki/Fixation_(population_genetics)","#cite_note-Dietrich_1994-2","/wiki/Molecular_evolution","/wiki/Bryan_Clarke","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Rollin_Richmond","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Neutralist/selectionist_controversy","#cite_note-Dietrich_1994-2","/w/index.php?title=Non-Darwinian_Evolution&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Non-Darwinian_Evolution&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/History_of_evolutionary_thought","/wiki/History_of_molecular_evolution","/w/index.php?title=Non-Darwinian_Evolution&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Non-Darwinian_Evolution&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/citation/164/3881/788","/wiki/Bibcode","http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1969Sci...164..788L","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.164.3881.788","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5767777","#cite_ref-Dietrich_1994_2-0","#cite_ref-Dietrich_1994_2-1","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2FBF01058626","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11639258","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Bibcode","http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1970Sci...168.1009C","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.168.3934.1009","/wiki/International_Standard_Serial_Number","//www.worldcat.org/issn/0036-8075","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4909620","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/Bibcode","http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1970Natur.225.1025R","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2F2251025a0","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5416467","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Non-Darwinian_Evolution&oldid=541596268","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1969_in_science","/wiki/Category:Academic_journal_articles","/wiki/Category:History_of_evolutionary_biology","/wiki/Category:Evolutionary_biology_literature","/wiki/Category:Molecular_evolution","/wiki/Category:Works_originally_published_in_Science_(journal)","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Non-Darwinian+Evolution&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Non-Darwinian+Evolution","/wiki/Non-Darwinian_Evolution","/wiki/Talk:Non-Darwinian_Evolution","#","/wiki/Non-Darwinian_Evolution","/w/index.php?title=Non-Darwinian_Evolution&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Non-Darwinian_Evolution&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Non-Darwinian_Evolution&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipe
