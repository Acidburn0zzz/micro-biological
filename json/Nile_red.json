It is produced by boiling a solution of Nile blue with\nsulfuric acid. As can be seen from the structural formulae, this\nprocess replaces an amino group with a carbonyl group. Nile red stains\nintracellular lipid droplets red. In most polar solvents Nile Red will not\nfluoresce, however when in a lipid-rich environment can be intensely\nfluorescent, with varying colours from deep red to strong yellow-gold emission.\nWhilst it generally excites at 485 nm, and emits at 525 nm (552/636 nm in\nmethanol), the fluorescence of the dye is heavily dependent on the solvent used,\nand in some cases does not fluoresce at all.\n\nSince the reaction to generate Nile red does not usually completely exhaust the\nsupply of Nile blue, additional separation steps are required if pure Nile red\nis needed.\n\n stained with Nile Red as a membrane dye (shown in red). This strain grows\n partly as cell chains, so a membrane dye may be useful to distinguish internal\n cell boundaries.]] Nile red has applications in cell biology, where it can be\n used as a membrane dye which can be readily visualised using an epifluorescence\n microscope with excitation and emission wavelengths usually shared with RFP.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Nile_red","recorded":1376428374,"links":[],"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fluorescent dyes","Oxazin dyes","Vital stains","Naphthobenzoxazines"],"headings":["References"],"image":[],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Methanol","Ethanol","Acetonitrile","Dimethylformamide","Acetone","Ethyl_acetate","Dichloromethane","Hexane","MTBE","Cyclohexane","Toluene","Lipophilic","Nile_blue","Sulfuric_acid","Cell_(biology)","Lipid","Membrane_dye","Epifluorescence_microscope"]}
