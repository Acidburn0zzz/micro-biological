This includes most soluble salts, acids, and bases. Some\ngases, such as hydrogen chloride, under conditions of high temperature or low\npressure can also function as electrolytes. Electrolyte solutions can also\nresult from the dissolution of some biological (e.g., DNA, polypeptides) and\nsynthetic polymers (e.g., polystyrene sulfonate), termed polyelectrolytes, which\ncontain charged functional groups.\n\nElectrolyte solutions are normally formed when a salt is placed into a solvent\nsuch as water and the individual components dissociate due to the thermodynamic\ninteractions between solvent and solute molecules, in a process called\nsolvation. For example, when table salt (sodium chloride), NaCl, is placed in\nwater, the salt (a solid) dissolves into its component ions, according to the\ndissociation reaction :NaCl (s) â Na +(aq) +\nCl â (aq) It is also possible for substances to react with\nwater producing ions, e.g., carbon dioxide gas dissolves in water to produce a\nsolution which contains hydronium, carbonate, and hydrogen carbonate ions.\n\nNote that molten salts can be electrolytes as well. For instance, when sodium\nchloride is molten, the liquid conducts electricity.\n\nAn electrolyte in a solution may be described as concentrated if it has a high\nconcentration of ions, or dilute if it has a low concentration. If a high\nproportion of the solute dissociates to form free ions, the electrolyte is\nstrong; if most of the solute does not dissociate, the electrolyte is weak. The\nproperties of electrolytes may be exploited using electrolysis to extract\nconstituent elements and compounds contained within the solution.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Electrolytes","recorded":1376427895,"links":[],"instances":["element","electricity","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electrolytes|","Blood tests","Urine tests","Physical chemistry","Acid-base physiology"],"headings":["Physiological importance","Electrochemistry","Solid electrolytes","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["base","chemistry"],["dissociation","chemistry"],["battery","electricity"],["mercury","element"]],"members":["mercury","battery","base","dissociation"],"related":["Solvent","Properties_of_water","Acid","Base_(chemistry)","Hydrogen_chloride","DNA","Polypeptides","Synthetic_polymer","Polystyrene_sulfonate","Polyelectrolyte","Functional_group","Solvation","Sodium_chloride","Electrolysis","Physiology","Sodium","Potassium","Calcium","Magnesium","Chloride","Hydrogen_phosphate","Hydrogen_carbonate","Dissociation_(chemistry)","Intracellular","Extracellular","Osmotic","Ion_gradient","Rehydration","Blood","PH","Nerve","Muscle","Extracellular_fluid","Interstitial_fluid","Intracellular_fluid","Plasma_membrane","Ion_channels","Muscle_contraction","Hormone","Kidney","Homeostasis","Antidiuretic_hormone","Aldosterone","Parathyroid_hormone","Electrolyte_disturbance","Dehydration","Water_intoxication","Medical_emergency","Blood_test","Ion_selective_electrode","Urinalysis","Medical_technologist","Medical_history","Renal_function","Arterial_blood_gas","Specific_gravity","Electrolyte_imbalance","Oral_rehydration_therapy","Water","Dehydration","Exercise","Alcohol_abuse","Diaphoresis","Diarrhea","Vomiting","Substance_intoxication","Starvation","Marathon","Triathlon","Hyponatremia","Fruit_juices","Coconut_water","Sports_drink","Potatoes","Avocados","Electrode","Voltage","Electron","Cathode","Anode","Sodium_chloride","Hydrogen","Chlorine","Diffusion","Battery_(electricity)","Material","Fuel_cell","Proton_conductor","Electroplating","Mercury_(element)","Electrolytic_capacitor","Dielectric","Electrical_insulation","Hygrometer","Strong_electrolyte","ITIES"]}
