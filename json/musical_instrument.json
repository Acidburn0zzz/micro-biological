This still life painting depicts a variety of\nFrench Baroque musical instruments, such as a natural horn, transverse flute,\nmusette, violin, and lute.]] A 'musical instrument' is a device created or\nadapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound can\nbe a musical instrumentâit is through purpose that the object becomes a musical\ninstrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human\nculture. Early musical instruments may have used for ritual: such as a trumpet\nto signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures\neventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment.\nMusical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.\n\nThe date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is\ndisputed. The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument,\na simple flute, dates back as far as 67,000 years. Some consensus dates early\nflutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that\ndetermining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible due to\nthe subjectivity of the definition and the relative instability of materials\nused to make them. Many early musical instruments were made from animal skins,\nbone, wood, and other non-durable materials.\n\nMusical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the\nworld. However, contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation\nof most instruments in places far from their origin. By the Middle Ages,\ninstruments from Mesopotamia were in Maritime Southeast Asia, and Europeans\nplayed instruments from North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred at a\nslower pace, but cultures of North, Central, and South America shared musical\ninstruments. By 1400, musical instrument development slowed in many areas and\nwas dominated by the Occident.\n\nMusical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right, and many\nsystems of classification have been used over the years. Instruments can be\nclassified by their effective range, their material composition, their size,\netc. However, the most common academic method, Hornbostel-Sachs, uses the means\nby which they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called\norganology.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"musical_instrument","recorded":1376418436,"links":[],"instances":["music","music","music","music","mythology","bible","flute","country","percussion_instrument","music","plant","percussion_instrument","instrument","sound","music","music","music","mythology","music","instrument"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Musical
