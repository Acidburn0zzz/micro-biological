According to IUPAC nomenclature it is\ncalled 'chromene'. There are two isomers of benzopyran that vary by the\norientation of the fusion of the two rings compared to the oxygen, resulting in\n1-benzopyran ('chromene') and 2-benzopyran ('isochromene')âthe number denotes\nwhere the oxygen atom is located by standard naphthalene-like nomenclature.\n\nThe radical form of benzopyran is paramagnetic. The unpaired electron is\ndelocalized over the whole benzopyran molecule, rendering it less reactive than\none would expect otherwise, a similar example is the cyclopentadienyl radical.\nCommonly, benzopyran is encountered in the reduced state, in which it is\npartially saturated with one hydrogen atom, introducing a tetrahedral\nCH 2 group in the pyran ring. Therefore, there are many structural\nisomers owing to the multiple possible positions of the oxygen atom and the\ntetrahedral carbon atom:\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|+Structural isomers of chromene - 2H-chromene (2H-1-\n|benzopyran) 4H-chromene (4H-1-benzopyran) -\n| 5H-chromene 7H-chromene - 8aH-\n|chromene }\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|+Structural isomers of isochromene - 1H-isochromene (1H-2-\n|benzopyran) 3H-isochromene (3H-2-benzopyran) }\n\n","linknr":-1,"url":"benzopyran","recorded":1376429390,"links":[],"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chromenes"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["radical","chemistry"]],"members":["radical"],"related":["Polycyclic_compound","Organic_compound","Benzene","Heterocyclic","Pyran","IUPAC","Naphthalene","Radical_(chemistry)","Paramagnetic","Cyclopentadienyl","Benzofuran","Benzopyrone"]}
