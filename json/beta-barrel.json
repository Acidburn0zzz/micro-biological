Porins are transmembrane proteins with hollow centers through which small\nmolecules can diffuse.]] retinol-binding protein (RBP), a canonical lipocalin\neight-strand barrel binding retinol (vitamin A).]] A 'beta barrel' is a large\nbeta-sheet that twists and coils to form a closed structure in which the first\nstrand is hydrogen bonded to the last. Beta-strands in beta-barrels are\ntypically arranged in an antiparallel fashion. Barrel structures are commonly\nfound in porins and other proteins that span cell membranes and in proteins that\nbind hydrophobic ligands in the barrel center, as in lipocalins. Porin-like\nbarrel structures are encoded by as many as 2â3% of the genes in Gram-negative\nbacteria.\n\nIn many cases the strands contain alternating polar and hydrophobic amino acids,\nso that the hydrophobic residues are oriented into the interior of the barrel to\nform a hydrophobic core and the polar residues are oriented toward the outside\nof the barrel on the solvent-exposed surface. Porins and other membrane proteins\ncontaining beta barrels reverse this pattern, with hydrophobic residues oriented\ntoward the exterior where they contact the surrounding lipids, and hydrophilic\nresidues oriented toward the interior pore.\n\nAll beta-barrels can be classified in terms of two integer parameters: the\nnumber of strands in the beta-sheet, n, and the \"shear number\", S, a measure of\nthe stagger of the strands in the beta-sheet. These two parameters (n\nand S) are related to the inclination angle of the beta strands relative to the\naxis of the barrel.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"beta-barrel","recorded":1376427642,"links":[],"instances":["zoology","geology","biochemistry","protein"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein structure","Protein folds"],"headings":["Types of beta barrels","Some functions of beta barrels","Shear number","Dynamical features","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["porin","protein"],["antiparallel","biochemistry"],["porin","protein"],["calyx","zoology"],["shear","geology"],["deformation","mechanics#strain"]],"members":["calyx","shear","antiparallel","porin","deformation"],"related":["Porin_(protein)","Transmembrane_protein","Lipocalin","Beta_strand","Retinol","Beta-sheet","Antiparallel_(biochemistry)","Porin_(protein)","Cell_membrane","Hydrophobic","Ligand","Gram-negative","Chemical_polarity","Hydrophobic","Amino_acid","Hydrophobic_core","Membrane_protein","Lipid","Primary_sequence","Structural_motif","Beta_hairpin","Diffusion","Bacterial_outer_membrane","Gram-negative","Chloroplast","Mitochondria","Translocase_of_the_outer_membrane","Sorting_and_assembly_machinery","Calyx_(zoology)","Retinol_binding_protein","Major_urinary_proteins","Retinol","Pheromones","Shear_(geology)","Beta_bulge","Green_fluorescent_protein","Raman_spectroscopy","Low-frequency_collective_motion_in_proteins_and_DNA","SCOP"]}
