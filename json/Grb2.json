In humans, the GRB2\nprotein is encoded by the GRB2 gene.\n\nThe protein encoded by this gene binds receptors such as the epidermal growth\nfactor receptor and contains one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains. Its two SH3\ndomains direct complex formation with proline-rich regions of other proteins,\nand its SH2 domain binds tyrosine phosphorylated sequences. This gene is similar\nto the sem-5 gene of [[Caenorhabditis elegans]], which is involved in the signal\ntransduction pathway. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding\ndifferent isoforms have been found for this gene.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Grb2","recorded":1376428347,"links":[],"instances":["gene","gene","genetics","protein","biology","gene"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Proteins","Cell signaling","Signal transduction"],"headings":["Function and expression","Domains","Interactions","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["ras","protein"],["crk","gene"],["src","gene"],["itk","gene"],["cblb","genetics"]],"members":["itk","src","cblb","ras","cell","crk"],"related":["Adaptor_protein","Signal_transduction","Cell_communication","Gene","Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor","SH2_domain","SH3_domain","Proline","Tyrosine","Phosphorylation","Alternative_splicing","Protein_isoform","Cell_(biology)","Embryo","Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor","Tyrosine_kinase","Ras_(protein)","Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase","SH2_domain","SH3_domain","GRAP2","GRAP","Hematopoietic","Tyrosine_kinase","Signal_transduction","SH2_domain","Phosphorylated","N-terminus","SH3_domain","Son_of_Sevenless","C-terminus","SH3_domain","Short_linear_motif","Proteinâ€“protein_interaction","Arachidonate_5-lipoxygenase","Lymphocyte_cytosolic_protein_2","GAB2","B-cell_linker","Abl_gene","CD28","FRS2","Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_9","CD22","NEU3","ETV6","MAP2","Dock180","PIK3R1","SH2B1","CRK_(gene)","GAB1","MST1R","DNM1","Huntingtin","Src_(gene)","Beta-2_adrenergic_receptor","VAV2","ADAM15","RAPGEF1","VAV1","HER2/neu","Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor","PDGFRB","PTK2","Erythropoietin_receptor","Linker_of_activated_T_cells","Dystroglycan","SH3KBP1","Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor_receptor","DCTN1","CDKN1B","Colony_stimulating_factor_1_receptor","EPH_receptor_A2","KHDRBS1","RET_proto-oncogene","PLCG1","TrkA","PRKAR1A","Janus_kinase_2","MUC1","CD117","Fas_ligand","Janus_kinase_1","VAV3","BCAR1","PTPN1","INPP5D","ITK_(gene)","SHC1","PTPN12","C-Met","PTPN11","Glycoprotein_130","PTPN6","Syk","MAP4K1","Wiskott-Aldrich_syndrome_protein","NCKIPSD","PTPRA","BCR_gene","CBLB_(genetics)","Cbl_gene","SOS1","IRS1","TNK2","MED28","MAP3K1","HNRNPC","MAPK/ERK_pathway","Information_Hyperlinked_over_Proteins"]}
