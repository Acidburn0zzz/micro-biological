However, the word \"claw\" is also often used in\nreference to an invertebrate. Somewhat similar fine hooked structures are found\nin arthropods such as beetles and spiders, at the end of the leg or tarsus for\ngripping a surface as the creature walks. Crabs', lobsters' and scorpions'\npincers, or more formally, their \"chelae\", are sometimes called claws.\n\nA claw is made of hard protein called keratin. Claws are used to catch and\nhold prey in carnivorous mammals such as cats and dogs, but may also be used\nfor such purposes as digging, climbing trees, self-defense etc., in those and\nother species.\n\nSimilar appendages that are flat and do not come to a sharp point are called\nnails instead. Claw-like projections that do not form at the end of digits, but\nspring from other parts of the foot are properly named spurs.\n\nClaws of animals like tigers, lions, and bears were used in making items\nsuch as ornaments, pendants, and brooches. Tigers' and lions' claws are\nillegal to trade.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"claw","recorded":1376418403,"links":[],"instances":["biology","anatomy","genus","zoology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animal anatomy","Dinosaur anatomy"],"headings":["Arthropods","Tetrapods","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["nail","anatomy"],["spur","zoology"],["homology","biology"],["equus","genus"],["nail","anatomy"],["nail","anatomy"]],"members":["homology","nail","equus","spur"],"related":["Amniote","Mammals","Reptiles","Birds","Invertebrate","Arthropod","Arthropod_leg","Chelae","Keratin","Nail_(anatomy)","Spur_(zoology)","Pangolin","Tetrapod","Keratin","Amphibian","African_clawed_frog","Amniote","Boidae","Bird_of_prey","Cassowary","Hoatzin","Extant_taxon","Walter_Lawry_Buller","Homology_(biology)","Hoof","Horse_hoof","Artiodactyla","Ungulate","Hair","Abscission","Human","Cat","Equus_(genus)","Horse","Donkey","Mule","Farrier","Predator","Protraction","Paw","Felidae","Primate","Nail_(anatomy)","Nail_(anatomy)","Callitrichids","Hallux","Prosimians","Toilet_claw","Lemurs","Lorises","Tarsiers","Aye-aye","Claw_of_Archimedes","Horse_hoof","Dactyly"]}
