A few other vertebrates such as the koala\n(which has two opposable thumbs on each \"hand\" and fingerprints remarkably\nsimilar to human fingerprints) are often described as having either \"hands\" or\n\"paws\" on their front limbs.\n\nHands are the main structures for physically manipulating the environment, used\nfor both gross motor skills (such as grasping a large object) and fine motor\nskills (such as picking up a small pebble). The fingertips contain some of the\ndensest areas of nerve endings on the body, are the richest source of tactile\nfeedback, and have the greatest positioning capability of the body; thus the\nsense of touch is intimately associated with hands. Like other paired organs\n(eyes, feet, legs), each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain\nhemisphere, so that handedness, or the preferred hand choice for single-handed\nactivities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning.\n\nSome evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of\ndigits on the forelimb more generally â for example, in the context of\nwhether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of\ntwo digits as in the dinosaur hand.\n\nThe human hand has 27 bones, not including the sesamoid bones which number\nvaries between people. 14 of which are the\nphalanges (proximal, intermediate and distal) of the fingers. The metacarpals\nare the bones that connects the fingers and the wrist. Each human hand has 5\nmetacarpals and 8 carpal bones.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Hand","recorded":1376418393,"links":[],"instances":["phylogenetics","kinesiology","anatomy","bone","biology","bone","skin","hand"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Upper limb anatomy","Hand|*"],"headings":["Definitions","Human anatomy","Evolution","Additional images","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["digit","anatomy"],["homology","biology"],["digit","anatomy"],["trapezium","bone"],["trapezium","bone"],["radius","bone"],["extension","kinesiology"],["flexor_digiti_minimi_brevis_muscle","hand"],["epidermis","skin"],["primitive","phylogenetics"]],"members":["primitive","extension","digit","radius","homology","trapezium","epidermis","flexor_digiti_minimi_brevis_muscle"],"related":["Dorsal_venous_network_of_hand","Ulnar_nerve","Median_nerve","Radial_nerve","Medicine","Latin","Prehensility","Finger","Primate","Human","Chimpanzee","Monkey","Lemur","Vertebrate","Gross_motor_skill","Grasp","Fine_motor_skill","Tactile","Sense_of_touch","Cerebral_hemisphere","Handedness","Anatomist","Digit_(anatomy)","Bird","Homology_(biology)","Dinosaur","Sesamoid_bone","Phalanges_of_the_hand","Proximal_phalanges","Intermediate_phalanges","Distal_phalange","Finger","Metacarpus","Wrist","Carpus","Mammal","Animal","Paw","Claw","Anthropomorphism","Primates","Thumb","Ape","Monkey","Hallux","Thumb","Digit_(anatomy)","Bird","Dinosaur","Metacarpus","Dermal_papillae","Fingerprint","Handstand","Finger","Index_finger","Middle_finger","Ring_finger","Little_finger","Thumb","Trapezium_(bone)","Skeleton","Short_bone","Wrist","Carpus","Scaphoid","Lunate_bone","Triquetral","Pisiform","Trapezium_(bone)","Trapezoid_bone","Capitate","Hamate","Metacarpus","Phalanx_bones","Supination","Pronation","Ulna","Radius_(bone)","Sesamoid_bone","Ossified","Interphalangeal_articulations_of_hand","Hinge_joint","Metacarpophalangeal_joint","Intercarpal_articulations","Wrist","Forearm","Transverse_carpal_ligament","Flexor_retinaculum_of_the_hand","Intercarpal_ligaments","Carpal_tunnel","Flexion","Extension_(kinesiology)","Thenar","Hypothenar","Dorsal_interossei_of_the_hand","Palmar_interossei_muscles","Lumbricals_of_the_hand","Flexor_digitorum_profundus_muscle","Opponens_pollicis","Abductor_pollicis_brevis_muscle","Anatomical_snuff_box","Abductor_pollicis_longus","Extensor_carpi_radialis_longus","Extensor_pollicis_longus","Extensor_indicis","Extensor_digiti_minimi","Extensor_carpi_ulnaris","Extensor_pollicis_brevis","Extensor_carpi_radialis_brevis","Extensor_digitorum_communis","Radial_nerve","Median_nerve","Ulnar_nerve","Abductor_pollicis_longus","Opponens_pollicis_muscle","Brachial_plexus","Extensor_carpi_radialis_longus_muscle","Extensor_carpi_radialis_brevis_muscle","Extensor_digitorum_muscle","Extensor_digiti_minimi_muscle","Extensor_carpi_ulnaris_muscle","Extensor_pollicis_longus_muscle","Extensor_pollicis_brevis_muscle","Extensor_indicis_muscle","Abductor_pollicis_longus_muscle","Flexor_carpi_radialis_muscle","Flexor_pollicis_longus_muscle","Flexor_digitorum_profundus_muscle","Flexor_digitorum_superficialis_muscle","Flexor_pollicis_brevis_muscle","Palmaris_longus_muscle","Abductor_pollicis_brevis_muscle","Opponens_pollicis_muscle","Lumbricals_of_the_hand","Flexor_carpi_ulnaris_muscle","Flexor_digitorum_profundus_muscle","Palmaris_brevis_muscle","Flexor_digiti_minimi_brevis_muscle_(hand)","Abductor_digiti_minimi_muscle_of_hand","Opponens_digiti_minimi_muscle","Adductor_pollicis_muscle","Flexor_pollicis_brevis_muscle","Palmar_interossei_muscles","Dorsal_interossei_of_the_hand","Lumbricals_of_the_hand","Glabrousness","Foot","Dermis","Melanin","Sun_tanning","Stratum_lucidum","Stratum_corneum","Epidermis_(skin)","Papillary_ridges","Mechanoreceptor","Sex_hormones","Embryo","In_utero","Polydactyly","Genetic_disorder","Catel-Manzke_syndrome","Syndactyly","Hand_infection","Hand_surgery","Carpal_tunnel_syndrome","Dupuytren's_contracture","Ulnar_claw","Bone_fracture","Scaphoid_fracture","Rolando_fracture","Bone_fracture","Intra-articular","Fracture","Metacarpal","Bennett's_fracture","First_metacarpal_bone","Carpometacarpal_joint","Boxer's_fracture","Metacarpal","Prehensile","Primate","Evolution","Arboreal","Tree_shrew","Stereoscopic_vision","Bipedalism","Paleolithic","Motor_cortex","Motoneuron","Central_nervous_system","Primitive_(phylogenetics)","Pentadactyly","Plesiomorphy","Miocene","Chimpanzee-human_last_common_ancestor","Anatomically_modern_humans","Derived_trait","Neanderthal","Acheulian","Spider_monkey","Hallux","Anthropometry","Dermatoglyphics","Hand_strength","Hand_walking","Handanalysis","Handstand","Knuckle-walking","Adobe_Flash"]}
