The dye is used as a\nhistological stain and in Gramâs method of classifying bacteria. Crystal violet\nhas antibacterial, antifungal, and anthelmintic properties and was formerly\nimportant as a topical antiseptic. The medical use of the dye has been largely\nsuperseded by more modern drugs, although it is still listed by the World Health\nOrganization.\n\nThe name \"gentian violet\" was originally used for a mixture of methyl\npararosaniline dyes (methyl violet) but is now often considered a synonym for\ncrystal violet. The name refers to its colour, being like that of the petals of\na gentian flower; it is not made from gentians or from violets.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Crystal_violet","recorded":1376428369,"links":[],"instances":["histology","medicine","dermatology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Triarylmethane dyes","Antifungals","Anilines","Disinfectants","Staining dyes","PH indicators","Chlorides"],"headings":["Production","Dye colour","Applications","History","Popular culture","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["fixation","histology"],["ulcer","dermatology"],["panacea","medicine"]],"members":["fixation","panacea","ulcer"],"related":["Triphenylmethane","Histological","Gram_staining","Antibacterial","Antifungal_medication","Anthelmintic","Topical","World_Health_Organization","Methyl_violet","Gentian","Dimethylaniline","Michler's_ketone","Phosphorus_oxychloride","Hydrochloric_acid","Formaldehyde","Dimethylaniline","Leuco_dye","Manganese_dioxide","Absorbance","Molar_absorptivity","PH","Acid_dissociation_constant","Nucleophile","Hydroxide","Electrophilic","Triphenylmethanol","Gram_staining","Gel_electrophoresis","Ethidium_bromide","Nanogram","Methyl_orange","DNA_cloning","Anthelmintic","Dentistry","Ringworm","Athlete's_foot","Jock_itch","Candidiasis","Candidiasis","Mouth_ulcer","Impetigo","Forensics","Fingerprint","Light_microscopy","Formalin","Fixation_(histology)","Tissue_culture","Laboratory_mice","Albino","Fur","Body_piercing","Surface_piercing","Methyl_violet","Saint-Denis","Pararosaniline","Basel","Phosgene","Heinrich_Caro","BASF","Diethylaniline","Dimethylaniline","Leipzig","Histology","Hans_Christian_Gram","Paul_Ehrlich","Victor_André_Cornil","Biological_Stain_Commission","Ophthalmologist","Jakob_Stilling","Merck_KGaA","Gram-negative_bacteria","Bacteriostatic_agent","Bactericide","Malachite_green","Ulcer_(dermatology)","Wound","Tattoo","Breastfeeding","La_Leche_League","Panacea_(medicine)","Engineering_traditions_in_Canada","Methyl_violet","Fluorescein","Prussian_blue","Egyptian_Blue","Methyl_blue","Methylene_blue","New_methylene_blue","Han_Purple","Potassium_ferrocyanide","Potassium_ferricyanide"]}
