Symptoms include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, and fever\nwhich usually resolve in seven to ten days, with some symptoms lasting up to\nthree weeks. Well over 200 viruses are implicated in the cause of the common\ncold; the rhinoviruses are the most common.\n\n Upper respiratory tract\ninfections are loosely divided by the areas they affect, with the common cold\nprimarily affecting the nose, the throat (pharyngitis), and the sinuses\n(sinusitis), occasionally involving either or both eyes via conjunctivitis.\nSymptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather\nthan to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. The primary method of\nprevention is by hand washing with some evidence to support the effectiveness of\nwearing face masks. The common cold may occasionally lead to pneumonia, either\nviral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia.\n\n No cure for the common cold exists,\nbut the symptoms can be treated. It is the most frequent infectious disease in\nhumans with the average adult contracting two to three colds a year and the\naverage child contracting between six and twelve. These infections have been\nwith humanity since antiquity.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Acute_viral_nasopharyngitis_(common_cold)","recorded":1376428983,"links":[],"instances":["uk","symptom","medical","antiviral"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Acute upper respiratory infections","Infectious diseases","Inflammations","Viral diseases","Enterovirus associated diseases"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Cause","Pathophysiology","Diagnosis","Prevention","Management","Prognosis","Epidemiology","History","Society and culture","Research directions","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["fatigue","medical"],["anorexia","symptom"],["medical_research_council","uk"],["draco","antiviral"]],"members":["medical_research_council","anorexia","fatigue","draco"],"related":["Rhinovirus","Infectious_disease","Upper_respiratory_tract","Cough","Sore_throat","Rhinorrhea","Sneeze","Fever","Rhinovirus","Upper_respiratory_tract_infection","Pharyngitis","Sinusitis","Conjunctivitis","Immune","Hand_washing","Pneumonia","Viral_pneumonia","Bacterial_pneumonia","Cough","Runny_nose","Nasal_congestion","Sore_throat","Myalgia","Fatigue_(medical)","Headache","Anorexia_(symptom)","Fever","Influenza","Asymptomatic","Sputum","Post-viral_cough","Rhinovirus","Picornavirus","Serovar","Coronavirus","Orthomyxoviridae","Adenoviridae","Human_parainfluenza_viruses","Human_respiratory_syncytial_virus","Enterovirus","Metapneumovirus","Fomites","Herd_immunity","Sleep_deprivation","Malnutrition","Breast_feeding","Acute_otitis_media","Lower_respiratory_tract_infections","Immune","ICAM-1","Inflammatory_mediators","Epithelium","Human_respiratory_syncytial_virus","Lower_respiratory_tract","Parainfluenza","Bronchus","Vertebrate_trachea","Croup","Upper_respiratory_tract_infections","Pharyngitis","Bronchitis","Rhinitis","Hand_washing","Quarantine","Vaccination","Viral_evolution","Antiviral_drug","Antibacterial","Social_distance","Vitamin_C","Gargling","Placebo_effect","Analgesics","Antipyretic","Ibuprofen","Paracetamol","Cough_medicine","Over-the-counter_drug","Dextromethorphan","Runny_nose","First-generation_antihistamine","Decongestant","Pseudoephedrine","Ipratropium","Second-generation_antihistamine","Chest_vapor_rub","Antibiotics","Antiviral_drug","Alternative_treatments_used_for_the_common_cold","Honey","Nasal_irrigation","Zinc","Vitamin_C","Echinacea","Garlic","Vitamin_D","Immunosuppressed","Sinusitis","Pharyngitis","Acute_otitis_media","Disease","Eskimo","Otitis_media","Ebers_papyrus","Common_Cold_Unit","Medical_Research_Council_(UK)","Interferon","Prophylaxis","World_War_II","Antibiotic_resistance","Pleconaril","Picornavirus","DRACO_(antiviral)","Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","University_of_Maryland,_College_Park","University_of_Wisconsinâ€“Madison","Genome"]}
