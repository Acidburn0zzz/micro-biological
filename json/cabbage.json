Closely related to other cole\ncrops, such as broccoli, cauliflower, and brussels sprouts, it descends from\nB.Â oleracea var. oleracea, a wild field cabbage. Cabbage heads generally\nrange from , and can be green, purple and white. Smooth-leafed firm-headed green\ncabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed red and crinkle-leafed savoy\ncabbages of both colors seen more rarely.\n\nIt is difficult to trace the exact history of cabbage, but it was most likely\ndomesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC. By the Middle Ages, it was a\nprominent part of European cuisine, although savoys were not developed until the\n16th century. Cabbage heads are generally picked during the first year of the\nplants' life cycles, but those intended for seed are allowed to grow a second\nyear, and must be kept separated from other cole crops to prevent cross\npollination. Cabbage is prone to several nutrient deficiencies, as well as\nmultiple pests, bacteria and fungal diseases.\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reports that\nworld production of cabbage and other brassicas (these plants are combined by\nthe FAO for reporting purposes) for calendar year 2010 was almost . Almost half\nwere grown in China. Cabbages are prepared in many different ways for eating,\nalthough pickling, in dishes such as sauerkraut, is the most popular. Cabbage is\na good source of beta-carotene, vitamin C, and fiber. Cabbage when contaminated\nis sometimes a source of food-borne illness in humans.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"cabbage","recorded":1376427890,"links":[],"instances":["botany","botany","brassica","historiography","plant_disorder","botany","botany","biology","biology","plants","plant_disorder","botany","horticulture"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medicinal plants","Leaf vegetables","Brassica oleracea|","Cultivars","Puerto Rican ingredients"],"headings":["Taxonomy and etymology","Description","History","Cultivation","Production","Culinary use","Nutrition and health","References","Cited literature","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["variety","botany"],["synonym","biology"],["petiole","botany"],["stigma","botany"],["style","botany"],["dehiscence","botany"],["petiole","botany"],["morphology","biology"],["dark_ages","historiography"],["bolting","horticulture"],["boron_deficiency","plant_disorder"],["calcium_deficiency","plant_disorder"],["potassium_deficiency","plants"],["blackleg","brassica"]],"members":["stigma","variety","blackleg","dark_ages","boron_deficiency","style","petiole","morphology","synonym","potassium_deficiency","calcium_deficiency","dehiscence","bolting"],"related":["White_cabbage","Red_cabbage","Savoy_cabbage","Biennial_plant","Annual_plant","Cole_crops","Broccoli","Cauliflower","Brussels_sprouts","Savoy_cabbage","Europe","Middle_Ages","Biological_life_cycle","Cross_pollination","Micronutrient_deficiency","Food_and_Agriculture_Organization","Brassica","China","Pickling","Sauerkraut","Beta-carotene","Vitamin_C","Fiber","Food-borne_illness","Brassicaceae","Cole_crops","Broccoli","Collard_greens","Brussels_sprouts","Kohlrabi","Sprouting_broccoli","Evolved","Selection","Variety_(botany)","Trinomial_nomenclature","Synonym_(biology)","Common_name","Crucifix","Celtic_languages","Late_Middle_English","Picard_language","Old_French","Cash","Tobacco","Vegetative_state","Tailoring","Canadian_English","Cabbagetown,_Toronto","Palm_tree","Seedling","Taproot","Cotyledon","Petiole_(botany)","Epicuticular_wax","Lateral_root","Inflorescence","Raceme","Petal","Sepal","Stamen","Superior_ovary","Stigma_(botany)","Style_(botany)","Stamen","Silique","Dehiscence_(botany)","Self-pollination","Cross-pollinated","Petiole_(botany)","Selective_breeding","Morphology_(biology)","Plant_breeding","Genetically_modified_food","Pesticide_resistance","Near_East","Pea","Wheat","Gout","Poisonous_mushroom","Dark_Ages_(historiography)","Middle_Ages","Jean_Ruel","Mesopotamia","Trade_routes","Savoy_cabbage","Staple_food","Sauerkraut","Scurvy","Jacques_Cartier","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","First_Fleet","Norfolk_Island","Sydney_Markets","Guinness_Book_of_World_Records","Cabbage_roll","Palmer,_Alaska","Republic_of_Macedonia","Soil_pH","Bolting_(horticulture)","Transplanting","Species","Cultivar","Red_cabbage","Micronutrient_deficiency","Boron_deficiency_(plant_disorder)","Calcium_deficiency_(plant_disorder)","Phosphorus_deficiency","Potassium_deficiency_(plants)","Rhizoctonia_solani","Fusarium","Blackleg_(Brassica)","Black_rot","Chlorosis","Necrosis","Wilting","Clubroot","Slime_mold","Downy_mildew","Oomycete","Mildew","Powdery_mildew","Root-knot_nematode","Cabbage_maggot","Aphid","Harlequin_bug","Thrip","Striped_flea_beetle","Caterpillar","Food_and_Agriculture_Organization","Vacuum_cooled","Fluoride","Sauerkraut","Kimchee","Chinese_cabbage","Bean_curd","Bubble_and_squeak","Polish_cuisine","Golabki","Pierogi","Coleslaw","Glucosinolates","Sulfur","Glucosides","Hydrogen_sulfide","Beta-carotene","Vitamin_C","Fiber","Cruciferous_vegetable","Colorectal_cancer","Sulphoraphane","Anticarcinogen","Anthocyanins","Indole-3-carbinol","DNA_repair","Food-borne_illness","Coleslaw","Pliny_the_Elder","Hangover","Cato_the_Elder","Compression_bandage","Ulcer","Mastitis","Trench_foot","Rheumatism","Sore_throat","Dysphonia","Baby_colic","Melancholy","Sunstroke","Croup","Poultice","Boil","Wart","Pneumonia","Appendicitis"]}
