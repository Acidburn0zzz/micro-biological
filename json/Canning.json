{"cursor":"25579","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n\n (1885)]]\n\n\n'Canning' is a method of preserving food in which the food contents are\nprocessed and sealed in an airtight container. Canning provides a typical shelf\nlife ranging from one to five years, although under specific circumstances a freeze-\ndried canned product, such as canned, dried lentils, can last as long as 30\nyears in an edible state.\n\nIn 1795 the French military offered a cash prize of 12,000 francs for a new\nmethod to preserve food. Nicolas Appert suggested canning and the process was\nfirst proven in 1806 in test with the French navy and the prize awarded in\n1809 or 1810. The packaging prevents microorganisms from entering and\nproliferating inside.\n\nTo prevent the food from being spoiled before and during containment, a number\nof methods are used: pasteurisation, boiling (and other applications of high\ntemperature over a period of time), refrigeration, freezing, drying, vacuum\ntreatment, antimicrobial agents that are natural to the recipe of the foods\nbeing preserved, a sufficient dose of ionizing radiation, submersion in a strong\nsaline solution, acid, base, osmotically extreme (for example very sugary) or\nother microbially-challenging environments.\n\nOther than sterilization, no method is perfectly dependable as a preservative.\nFor example, the microorganism [[Clostridium botulinum]] (which causes\nbotulism), can only be eliminated at temperatures above the boiling point.\n\nFrom a public safety point of view, foods with low acidity (a pH more than 4.6)\nneed sterilization under high temperature (116-130 Â°C). To achieve temperatures\nabove the boiling point requires the use of a pressure canner. Foods that must\nbe pressure canned include most vegetables, meat, seafood, poultry, and dairy\nproducts. The only foods that may be safely canned in an ordinary boiling water\nbath are highly acidic ones with a pH below 4.6,  such as fruits,\npickled vegetables, or other foods to which acidic additives have been added.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Canning","recorded":1376428440,"links":[],"instances":["inventor","food","microbiology","container"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Canned food|","Canneries","Food industry","Food storage containers","Packaging","Industrial processes","French inventions"],"headings":["History and development of canning","Double seams","Potential hazards","Canning and economic recession","Notable canned foods","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["sterilization","microbiology"],["lid","container"],["spam","food"],["amanda_jones","inventor"]],"members":["amanda_jones","spam","sterilization","lid"],"related":["Food_preservation","Lentil","Nicolas_Appert","Packaging","Microorganism","Sterilization_(microbiology)","Botulism","Acidity","PH","Pressure_cooking","Vegetable","Meat","Seafood","Poultry","Dairy","Acid","Fruit","Pickling","Napoleonic_Wars","Nicolas_Appert","Louis_Pasteur","Tin_can","Peter_Durand","Home_canning","Can_opener","Bayonet","First_French_Empire","Six_Days_Campaign","France","Napoleonic_Wars","Tin_can","Philippe_de_Girard","Bryan_Donkin","British_Army","Royal_Navy","William_Edward_Parry","James_Clark_Ross","Europe","Novelties","Lead","Solder","Franklin's_lost_expedition","Northwest_Passage","New_York_City","Oyster","Meat","Fruit","Vegetable","Crimean_War","American_Civil_War","Franco-Prussian_War","Victorian_era","United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","William_Underwood_Company","Nestlé","H._J._Heinz_Company","Working_class","World_War_I","Calorie","Field_ration","Trench_warfare","Corned_beef","Pork_and_beans","French_Army","French_cuisine","Coq_au_vin","Italian_Army","Ravioli","Bolognese_sauce","British_Army","Cigarette","Amphetamine","Steel","Aseptic_processing","Meal,_Ready-to-Eat","Capri_Sun","Can_seamer","Hermetic_seal","Tin_can","Tin_plate","Lid_(container)","Solder","Top_hat","Rubber","Clearance_gauge","Double_seam","Springback","Wrinkle","Statistical_Process_Control","Can_seamer","Shelf_life","Dietary_fiber","Vitamin","Lycopene","Can_Manufacturers_Institute","Crown_Holdings,_Inc.","Ball_Corporation","Lead_poisoning","Bisphenol_A","Endocrine_disruptor","Dietary_salt","Hypertension","Home_canning","Paralytic","Respiratory_failure","Medical_emergency","Public_health","Cocooning","Baked_beans","Canned_sardines","Canned_tuna","Pineapple","Spam_(food)","Tomato_soup","Vienna_sausage","Amanda_Jones_(inventor)","Vacuum","Canned_fish","Canned_water","Canstruction","Food_industry","Food_preservation","Home_canning","Pasteurization","Salmon_cannery"]}
