This high blood sugar produces the classical\nsymptoms of polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst) and\npolyphagia (increased hunger).\n\nThere are three main types of diabetes mellitus (DM). *Type 1 DM results\nfrom the body's failure to produce insulin, and currently requires the person to\ninject insulin or wear an insulin pump. This form was previously referred to as\n\"insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\" (IDDM) or \"juvenile diabetes\".\n*Type 2 DM results from insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail\nto use insulin properly, sometimes combined with an absolute insulin deficiency.\nThis form was previously referred to as non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\n(NIDDM) or \"adult-onset diabetes\". *The third main form, gestational diabetes\noccurs when pregnant women without a previous diagnosis of diabetes develop a\nhigh blood glucose level. It may precede development of type 2 DM.\n\nOther forms of diabetes mellitus include congenital diabetes, which is due to\ngenetic defects of insulin secretion, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, steroid\ndiabetes induced by high doses of glucocorticoids, and several forms of\nmonogenic diabetes.\n\nUntreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications include\ndiabetic ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperosmolar coma. Serious long-term\ncomplications include cardiovascular disease, chronic renal failure, and\ndiabetic retinopathy (retinal damage). Adequate treatment of diabetes is thus\nimportant, as well as blood pressure control and lifestyle factors such as\nstopping smoking and maintaining a healthy body weight.\n\nAll forms of diabetes have been treatable since insulin became available in\n1921, and type 2 diabetes may be controlled with medications. Insulin\nand some oral medications can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugars), which\ncan be dangerous if severe. Both types 1 and 2 are chronic conditions that\ncannot be cured. Pancreas transplants have been tried with limited\nsuccess in type 1 DM; gastric bypass surgery has been successful in many\nwith morbid obesity and type 2 DM. Gestational diabetes usually resolves\nafter delivery.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"diabetic","recorded":1376427900,"links":[],"instances":["biochemistry","physician","genetics","medicine","medicine","medical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Diabetes|","Nutrition"],"headings":["Classification","Signs and symptoms","Causes","Pathophysiology","Diagnosis","Management","Epidemiology","History","Society and culture","Other animals","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["acute","medical"],["chronic","medicine"],["concordance","genetics"],["etiology","medicine"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["apollonius","physician"]],"members":["receptor","apollonius","concordance","etiology","chronic","acute"],"related":["Blood_sugar","Pancreas","Insulin","Polyuria","Polydipsia","Polyphagia","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Insulin_resistance","Gestational_diabetes","Genetics","Cystic_fibrosis","Glucocorticoid","MODY","Acute_(medical)","Diabetic_ketoacidosis","Nonketotic_hyperosmolar_coma","Cardiovascular_disease","Chronic_renal_failure","Diabetic_retinopathy","Blood_pressure","Tobacco_smoking","Human_weight","Insulin","Hypoglycemia","Chronic_(medicine)","Pancreas_transplant","Gastric_bypass_surgery","Morbid_obesity","Obese","Diabetic_ketoacidosis","Autoantibodies","Concordance_(genetics)","Identical_twin","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Gestational_diabetes","Diabetes_insipidus","Beta_cell","Islets_of_Langerhans","T-cell","Autoimmunity","Glucose","Insulin","Hyperglycemia","Ketosis","Hypoglycemia","Insulin_resistance","Insulin_receptor","Anti-diabetic_drug","Liver","Pregnancy","Macrosomia","Surfactant","Infant_respiratory_distress_syndrome","Hyperbilirubinemia","Labor_induction","Caesarean_section","Macrosomia","Shoulder_dystocia","Prediabetes","Latent_autoimmune_diabetes_of_adults","Etiology_(medicine)","Autosomal_dominant","Mitochondrial","Beta_cell","Pancreas","Chronic_pancreatitis","Cystic_fibrosis","Insulin_receptor","Hormone","ICD-10","World_Health_Organization","Polyuria","Polydipsia","Polyphagia","Diabetic_dermadromes","Diabetic_ketoacidosis","Acetone","Kussmaul_breathing","Abdominal_pain","Nonketotic_hyperosmolar_coma","Blood_vessel","Cardiovascular_disease","Macrovascular_disease","Atherosclerosis","Ischemic_heart_disease","Angina","Myocardial_infarction","Stroke","Peripheral_vascular_disease","Capillaries","Microangiopathy","Diabetic_retinopathy","Retina","Blindness","Diabetic_nephropathy","Glomerulosclerosis","Microalbuminuria","Proteinuria","Chronic_kidney_disease","Dialysis","Diabetic_neuropathy","Peripheral_nervous_system","Diabetic_foot","Diabetic_foot_ulcer","Amputation","Proximal_diabetic_neuropathy","Muscle_wasting","Cognitive_deficit","Coxsackie_B4_virus","Human_leukocyte_antigen","Genotype","Maturity_onset_diabetes_of_the_young","Proinsulin","Chronic_pancreatitis","Pancreatectomy","Pancreatic_neoplasia","Cystic_fibrosis","Hemochromatosis","Fibrocalculous_pancreatopathy","Endocrinopathies","Acromegaly","Cushing_syndrome","Hyperthyroidism","Pheochromocytoma","Glucagonoma","Cytomegalovirus_infection","Coxsackie_B4_virus","Glucocorticoids","Thyroid_hormone","Β-adrenergic_agonist","Statins","Sucrose","Starch","Glucose","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Carbohydrate_metabolism","Monosaccharide","Glucose","Glycogen","Glucagon","Anabolism","Protein_biosynthesis","Lipid","Catabolism","Acidosis","Renal_threshold","Transport_maximum","Reabsorption","Proximal_tubule","Urine","Glycosuria","Osmotic_pressure","Polyuria","Dehydration","Plasma_glucose","Glucose_tolerance_test","Glycated_hemoglobin","Impaired_fasting_glycemia","Impaired_glucose_tolerance","Glycated_hemoglobin","Fasting_glucose","Chronic_disease","Tobacco_smoking","Hypercholesterolemia","Obesity","Hypertension","Exercise","Orthotics","Metformin","Aspirin","Insulin","Insulin_analogs","General_practitioner","United_Kingdom","Telehealth","Circa","Common_Era","Apollonius_(physician)","Roman_empire","Galen","Aretaeus_of_Cappadocia","Diabetes_insipidus","Frederick_Banting","Charles_Herbert_Best","Latin","Ancient_Greek","Siphon","Ancient_Greece","Physician","Aretaeus_of_Cappadocia","Floruit","Common_Era","Thomas_Willis","Glycosuria","St._Vincent_Declaration","Paresthesia","Unemployed","Poodle","Open_Directory_Project"]}
