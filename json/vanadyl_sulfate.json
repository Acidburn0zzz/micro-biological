This very hygroscopic blue solid is one of the most common sources of\nvanadium in the laboratory, reflecting its high stability. It features the\nvanadyl ion, VO 2+ , which has been called the \"most stable diatomic\nion.\" Vanadyl sulfate is an intermediate in the extraction\nof vanadium from petroleum residues, a major commercial source of\nvanadium.

Vanadyl\ncompounds mimic the effects of insulin, although humans seem to have no dietary\nrequirement for vanadium.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"vanadyl_sulfate","recorded":1376428448,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Vanadium compounds","Sulfates"],"headings":["Synthesis, structure, and reactions","Occurrence in nature","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["vanadium(iii_sulfate"],["vanadium(v_oxide"]],"members":[],"related":["Vanadyl_chloride","Vanadyl_nitrate","Vanadium(III)_sulfate","Vanadyl_acetylacetonate","Inorganic_compound","Vanadium","Dietary_mineral","Vanadium(V)_oxide","Sulfur_dioxide","Water_of_crystallization","Coordination_complex","Octahedral_molecular_geometry","Picometer","Vanadyl_acetylacetonate","Acetylacetone","Zinc","Fumarolic"]}
