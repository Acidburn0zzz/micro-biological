[http://catalog.miniscience.com/catalog/Glassware/Test_Tube.html\nMiniScience.com catalog: Test Tube], accessed March 27, 2009 The top often\nfeatures a flared lip to aid pouring out the contents; some sources consider\nthat the presence of a lip is what distinguishes a test tube from a culture\ntube.

A test\ntube has either a flat bottom, a round bottom, or a conical bottom. Some test\ntubes are made to accept a ground glass stopper or a screw cap. They are often\nprovided with a small ground glass or white glaze area near the top for labeling\nwith a pencil.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"test_tube","recorded":1376427903,"links":[],"instances":["mixed_drink","tool","plug","plant","pottery"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Laboratory glassware"],"headings":["Uses","Manufacture","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["glaze","pottery"],["cutting","plant"],["stopper","plug"],["clamp","tool"],["shooter","mixed_drink"]],"members":["shooter","clamp","stopper","cutting","glaze"],"related":["Chemical_reaction","Vacutainer","Boiling_tube","Centrifuge_tube","Laboratory_glassware","Glass","Plastic","Ground_glass_joint","Screw_cap","Ground_glass","Glaze_(pottery)","Microscope","Test_tubes","Chemist","Beaker","Gas","Electrolysis","Biology","Organisms","Molds","Bacteria","Seedling","Cutting_(plant)","Medicine","Forensics","Blood","Stopper_(plug)","Test_tube_rack","Clamp_(tool)","Test_tube_tongs","Culture_medium","Flower_vase","Shooter_(mixed_drink)","Spice","Microtiter_plate","Borosilicate_glass","Bunsen_burner","Polystyrene","Polypropylene","Injection_molding","Trisodium_citrate","Biological_specimen","Coagulation_screen","Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase","Graduated_cylinder"]}
