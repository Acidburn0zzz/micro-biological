It\nis produced by the liver, and is a major component of the alpha-2 band in\nprotein electrophoresis.\n\nAlpha 2-Macroglobulin is the largest major nonimmunoglobulin protein in plasma.\nThe alpha 2-macroglobulin molecule is synthesized mainly in liver, but also\nlocally by macrophages, fibroblasts, and adrenocortical cells.\n\nAlpha 2 macroglobulin acts as an antiprotease and is able to inactivate an\nenormous variety of proteinases. It functions as an inhibitor of fibrinolysis\nby inhibiting plasmin and kallikrein. It functions as an inhibitor of\ncoagulation by inhibiting thrombin. Alpha 2-macroglobulin may act as a carrier\nprotein because it also binds to numerous growth factors and cytokines, such as\nplatelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, TGF-Î², insulin,\nand IL-1Î².\n\nNo specific deficiency with associated disease has been recognized, and no\ndisease state is attributed to low concentrations of Alpha 2 macroglobulin.\n\nThe concentration of alpha 2 macroglobulin rises 10-fold or more in the\nnephrotic syndrome when other lower molecular weight proteins are lost in the\nurine. The loss of alpha 2 macroglobulin into urine is prevented by its large\nsize. The net result is that alpha 2 macroglobulin reaches serum levels equal to\nor greater than those of albumin in the nephrotic syndrome, which has the effect\nof maintaining oncotic pressure.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"alpha-2-Macroglobulin","recorded":1376427638,"links":[],"instances":["biochemistry","biochemistry","biology","molecular","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Acute phase proteins"],"headings":["Structure","Function","Disease","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["protease_inhibitor","biology"],["protease_inhibitor","biology"],["substrate","biochemistry"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["binding","molecular"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["polymorphism","biology"]],"members":["receptor","substrate","polymorphism","binding","protease_inhibitor"],"related":["Plasma_protein","Blood","Liver","Protein_electrophoresis","Oncotic_pressure","Protein_family","Protease_inhibitor_(biology)","Homo_sapiens","Tetrameric_protein","Proteinase","Enzyme_inhibitor","Protease","Catalytic","Thiol","Ester","Amine","Protease_inhibitor_(biology)","Steric","Bond_cleavage","Proteolytic","Conformational_change","Active_site","Steric_effects","Protein","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Protein_structure","Conserved_sequence","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Binding_(molecular)","Protein_complex","Molecular_binding","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Serine_proteinase","Cysteine-proteinase","Aspartic_proteinase","Metalloproteinase","Fibrinolysis","Plasmin","Coagulation","Thrombin","Nephrotic_syndrome","Kidney","Chronic_renal_failure","Amyloid","Polymorphism_(biology)","Alzheimer's_disease","MEROPS"]}
