His work offers a\nbleak, tragicomic outlook on human nature, often coupled with black comedy and\ngallows humour.\n\nBeckett is widely regarded as among the most influential writers of the 20th\ncentury. McDonald, RÃ³nÃ¡n (ed). (2007), The Cambridge Introduction to Samuel\nBeckett, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge p17 He is considered one of\nthe last modernists. As an inspiration to many later writers, he is also\nsometimes considered one of the first postmodernists. He is one of the key\nwriters in what Martin Esslin called the \"Theatre of the Absurd\". His work\nbecame increasingly minimalist in his later career.\n\nBeckett was awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his writing,\nwhichâin new forms for the novel and dramaâin the destitution of modern man\nacquires its elevation\". He was elected Saoi of AosdÃ¡na in 1984.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Samuel_Beckett","recorded":1376429245,"links":[],"instances":["director","photographer","novel","arts","dublin_artist","novel","world_war_ii","literary_journal","comedian","magazine","poet","publishing_company","literary_theorist","poet","literature"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Samuel
