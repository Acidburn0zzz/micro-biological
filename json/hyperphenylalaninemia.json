{"cursor":"3812","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{Infobox disease\n| Name = Hyperphenylalaninemia Image = Caption = Phenylalanine\n\n| ICD10 = (also includes non-classic PKU) ICD9 = (PKU) ICDO = OMIM = 261600\n| OMIM_mult =\n MeshID\n| = D010661\n}} 'Hyperphenylalaninemia' is a medical condition characterized by mildly or\nstrongly elevated levels of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood. Severe\nhyperphenylalaninemia results in '[[phenylketonuria]]'\n(PKU)[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=261600]. Phenylalanine\nconcentrations ([phe]) are routinely screened in newborns by the Guthrie test,\nwhich takes a few drops of blood from the heel of the infant. Standard [phe]\nconcentrations in unaffected persons are ~60 uM: [phe] concentrations in\npersons with untreated phenylketonuria may be times 600 ~ 2400 uM, which\nindicate that the child is at risk for severe mental retardation.\nPhenylketonuria is classed as an autosomal recessive condition: in\nheterozygotes from, [phe] shows a moderate elevation, perhaps two-fold over\nunaffected homozygotes, which is classified as Hyperphenylalaninemia [hyper +\nphenylalanine + emia = high phe in blood].\n\nPersons with the genotype for PKU are unaffected in utero because maternal\ncirculation prevents buildup of [phe]. After birth, PKU in newborns is treated\nby a special diet with highly restricted phenylalanine content. Persons with\ngenetic predisposition to PKU have normal mental development on this diet.\nPreviously, it was thought safe to withdraw from the diet in the late teens or\nearly twenties, after the central nervous system was fully developed; recent\nstudies suggest some degree of relapse and a phenylalanine-restricted diet is\nnow recommended.\n\nPKU or Hyperphenylalaninemia may also occur in persons without the PKU genotype.\nIf the mother has the PKU genotype but has been treated so as to be\nasymptomatic, high levels of [phe] in the maternal blood circulation may affect\nthe non-PKU fetus during gestation. Mothers successfully treated for PKU are\nadvised to return to the [phe]-restricted diet during pregnancy.\n\nA small subset of patients with hyperphenylalaninemia shows an appropriate\nreduction in plasma phynylalanine levels with dietary restriction of this\namino acid; however, these patients still develop progressive neurologic\nsymptoms and seizures and usually die within the first 2 years of life\n(\"malignant\" hyperphenylalaninemia). These infants exhibit normal\nphenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity but have a deficiency in\ndihydropteridine reductase (DHPR), an enzyme required for the regeneration of\ntetrahydrobiopterin (THB), a cofactor of PAH.\n\nLess Frequently, DHPR activity is normal but a defect in the biosyntheses of THB\nexists. In either case, dietary therapy corrects the hyperphenylalaninemia.\nHowever, THB is also a cofactor for two other hydroxylations required in the\nsyntheses of neurotransmitters in the brain: the hydroxylation of tryptophan to\n5-hydroxytryptophan and of tyrosine to L-dopa. It has been suggested that the\nresulting deficit in the CNS neurotransmitter activity is, at least in part,\nresponsible for the neurologic manifestations and eventual death of these\npatients.
