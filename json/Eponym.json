Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc.\n[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/eponym \"eponym\"]. Retrieved June 4,\n2012. For example, LÃ©on Theremin is the eponym of the theremin; Louis\nBraille is the eponym of the Braille word system created by him for use by the\nblind. Eponyms are aspects of etymology.\n\nA synonym of \"eponym\" is 'namegiver' (not to be confused with namesake). Someone\nwho (or something that) is referred to with the adjective 'eponymous' is the\neponym of something. An example is: \"LÃ©on Theremin, known as the eponymous\ninventor of the theremin.\"\n\nAn etiological myth can be a \"reverse eponym\" in the sense that a legendary\ncharacter is invented in order to explain a term, such as the nymph Pirene, who\naccording to myth was turned into Pirene's Fountain.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Eponym","recorded":1376428044,"links":[],"instances":["album","swedish_band","tribe","fountain","album","band","spacecraft","band","song","singer","band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Eponyms|*","Figures of speech"],"headings":["History","Other eponyms","Lists of eponyms","Orthographic conventions","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["orion","spacecraft"],["pirene","mythology"],["pirene","fountain"],["achaeans","tribe"],["blur","band"],["bad_company","band"],["bad_company","song"],["santana","band"],["the_chicago_transit_authority","album"],["chicago","band"],["chicago","band"],["ghost","swedish_band"],["roberto_carlos","singer"],["they_might_be_giants","album"],["list_of_eponyms","a-k"],["list_of_eponyms","l-z"]],"members":["the_chicago_transit_authority","ghost","achaeans","pirene","they_might_be_giants","chicago","orion","list_of_eponyms","blur","bad_company","roberto_carlos","santana"],"related":["Orion_(spacecraft)","Toponym","Ethnonym","Regnal_year","Léon_Theremin","Theremin","Etymology","Synonym","Namesake","Adjective","Pirene_(mythology)","Pirene_(fountain)","Assyrian_people","Ancient_Greece","Archons_of_Athens","Athens","Archons_of_Athens","Solon","Fifth-century_Athens","Pericles","Ancient_Rome","Consul","Bibulus","Julius_Caesar","Christian_era","Regnal_year","Intellectual_property_law","Genericized_trademark","Metonymy","Achaeus,_son_of_Xuthus","Achaeans_(tribe)","Dorus","Dorians","Sons_of_Noah","Ethnology","Peloponnesus","Pelops","Vancouver,_British_Columbia","George_Vancouver","Prince_Albert,_Saskatchewan","Isbister's_Settlement","Queen_Victoria","Albert,_Prince_Consort","Avogadro's_number","Diesel_engine","Meitnerium","Alzheimer's_disease","Apgar_score","Stigler's_law_of_eponymy","Book","Film","Video_game","Television_program","Music","Blur_(band)","Bad_Company_(band)","Bad_Company_(song)","Tindersticks","Metallica","Led_Zeppelin","Crowded_House","Van_Halen","Duran_Duran","Bang_Camaro","Santana_(band)","Living_in_a_Box","Ramones","The_Chicago_Transit_Authority_(album)","Hot_Streets","Chicago_(band)","Chicago_(band)","Roman_numeral","Peter_Gabriel","R.E.M.","Ghost_(Swedish_band)","Roberto_Carlos_(singer)","They_Might_Be_Giants_(album)","List_of_eponyms_(A-K)","List_of_eponyms_(L-Z)","List_of_eponymous_albums","Adages_named_after_people","List_of_eponymous_adjectives_in_English","List_of_minor_planets_named_after_people","Astronomical_objects_named_after_people","Cartoon_characters_named_after_people","Chemical_elements_named_after_people","List_of_colleges_and_universities_named_after_people","List_of_companies_named_after_people","List_of_eponymous_diseases","List_of_foods_named_after_people","Human_anatomical_parts_named_after_people","List_of_ideologies_named_after_people","List_of_inventions_named_after_people","List_of_theorems","List_of_eponymous_medical_signs","List_of_eponymous_medical_treatments","List_of_minerals_named_after_people","Observations_named_after_people","List_of_places_named_after_people","Prizes_named_after_people","Scientific_constants_named_after_people","Scientific_equations_named_after_people","Scientific_laws_named_after_people","Scientific_phenomena_named_after_people","Scientific_units_named_after_people","Sports_terms_named_after_people","List_of_eponyms_of_stadiums","List_of_eponyms_of_stadiums_in_the_United_States","List_of_eponymous_surgical_procedures","List_of_generic_and_genericized_trademarks","Proper_nouns","James_Parkinson","The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style","Genitive","Postprint","American_and_British_English_spelling_differences","Antonomasia","Archetypal_name","Eponymous_hairstyles","Ethnonym","Etymology","Lists_of_etymologies","False_etymology","Genericized_trademark","Medical_eponyms","Metonym","Name_reaction","Stigler's_law_of_eponymy","Toponym","H2g2"]}
