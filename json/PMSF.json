PMSF does not inhibit all serine proteases. It is rapidly degraded\nin water and stock solutions are usually made up in anhydrous ethanol,\nisopropanol, corn oil, or DMSO. Proteolytic inhibition occurs when a\nconcentration between 0.1 - 1 mM PMSF is used. The half-life is short in aqueous\nsolutions (110 min at pH 7, 55 min at pH 7.5, and 35 min at pH 8, all at\n25Â°C).\n\nPMSF binds specifically to the active site serine residue in a serine protease.\nIt does not bind to any other serine residues in the protein. This is a result\nof the hyperactivity of that serine residue caused by the specific environmental\nconditions in the enzyme's active site. Because PMSF binds covalently to the\nenzyme, the complex can be viewed by X-ray crystallography; it can therefore be\nused as a chemical label to identify an essential active site SER in an enzyme.\n\n:Enzyme(active)Ser-O-H + F-\nSO 2CH 2C 6H 5 â EnzymeSer-O-\nSO 2CH 2C 6H 5 + HF\n\n:Serine protease + PMSF â Irreversible enzyme-PMS complex + HF\n\nThe is less than 500 mg/kg. PMSF is a cytotoxic chemical which should be\nhandled only inside a fume hood.\n\nPMSF is commonly used in protein solublization in order to deactivate proteases\nfrom digesting proteins of interest after cell lysis.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"PMSF","recorded":1376427646,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protease inhibitors","Serine protease inhibitors","Sulfonyl halides"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biochemistry","Cell_lysate","Serine_protease","Ethanol","Isopropanol","Corn_oil","Dimethyl_sulfoxide","Serine","Cytotoxic","MEROPS","Peptidase","Peptidase_inhibitor"]}
