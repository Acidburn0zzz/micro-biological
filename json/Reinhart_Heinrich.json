Among his services to the scientific\ncommunity, Reinhart was associate editor of [[PLoS Computational Biology]]. His\nfar-reaching theoretical work on metabolism, signal transduction, and other\ncellular processes has made him one of the most influential forerunners of present-\nday systems biology. Reinhart's many talents made him appear as a modern\nRenaissance man. He played the violin, and published an autobiographic novel\n(Jenseits von Babel) and several works of lyric poetry for which he received the\nBrigitte Reimann Prize.\n\nReinhart Heinrich was born in Dresden and lived at first in the Soviet Union\nwhere his father - a German aircraft constructor - was taken after the Second\nWorld War to work. Having been educated as a theoretical physicist at Dresden\nUniversity of Technology in East Germany, Reinhart conducted his postdoctoral\nresearch in the early 1970s at the CharitÃ©'s Institute of Biochemistry in East\nBerlin. He could not fail to notice the absence of mathematical theory from cell\nbiology as compared with other natural sciences. Enzyme kinetics was a notable\nexception. However, how enzymes affect the flux through a metabolic pathway was\nstill discussed using the rather vague term rate-limiting step. Working with\nProfessor Rapoport on mathematical models of glycolysis in red blood cells,\nReinhart discovered a precise and general definition of rate limitation in\nmetabolic pathways, for which he received the Humboldt Prize. He extended his\nknowledge in this area, working for Professor Puschtschino in Moscow, who als\nworked on mathematic modelling of metabolic processes.\n\nThe parallel development of metabolic control theory by Henrik Kacser and Jim\nBurns in Edinburgh shows that the time was ripe for a quantitative understanding\nof metabolic regulation. Instead of postulating a single rate-limiting step,\nReinhart's and Henrik Kacser's theories evaluated the degree of flux control\nexerted by an individual enzyme in a linear pathway or in a more complex\nnetwork. The corresponding measure - termed flux control coefficient - turned\nout to be a truly systemic quantity, depending not only on the kinetic\nparameters of the enzyme itself but also on those of other enzymes, as well as\non the position of the reaction in the network. Several years after its original\npublication, metabolic control theory became widely absorbed by biochemists.\nControl coefficients have been measured for many pathways, confirming the\ntheoretical prediction that flux control is frequently shared by several\nreactions. This finding has recently become of very practical importance for the\ngenetic engineering of large metabolic networks in biotechnology.\n\nThe dual approach - modeling concrete cellular processes and, at the same time,\nsearching for general laws - has been a characteristic of Reinhart's work. The\nareas he worked in were amazingly diverse, including metabolic control,\nosmoregulation, cell shapes, signal transduction, vesicular transport, protein\ntranslation and transport, as well as the population dynamics of malaria\nparasites.\n\nPerhaps his most favored questions were those of evolution. To understand the\nkinetic design of enzymes and enzymatic reaction networks, Reinhart strove to\nrationalize, in mathematical terms, the selective pressures and physicoâchemical\nconstraints that these systems were subjected to. Reinhart's work on this topic\nis full of original insight and makes specific predictions, some of which have\nbegun to be tested successfully in recent years.\n\nReinhart was author of more than 160 research articles and, together with Stefan\nSchuster, wrote the book The Regulation of Cellular Systems - already a classic\nof cell systems biology. In addition to this large body of original work, he was\na gifted mentor of young scientists and for more than ten years ran the highly\nsuccessful interdisciplinary graduate program Dynamics and Evolution of Cellular\nProcesses at Humboldt University, Berlin. In 1996 he received a Honorary degree\nfrom the University of Bordeaux.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Reinhart_Heinrich","recorded":1376423925,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Reinhart_Heinrich&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Reinhart_Heinrich&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhart_Heinrich","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/File:Reinhart_Heinrich_1946%E2%80%932006.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Reinhart_Heinrich_1946%E2%80%932006.jpg/220px-Reinhart_Heinrich_1946%E2%80%932006.jpg","/wiki/Dresden","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Systems_biology","/wiki/Biophysics","/wiki/Humboldt_University_of_Berlin","/wiki/Charit%C3%A9","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/Dresden_University_of_Technology","/wiki/Metabolism","/wiki/Signal_transduction","/wiki/Humboldt_Prize","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Biophysicist","/wiki/Humboldt_University_of_Berlin","/wiki/PLoS_Computational_Biology","/wiki/Metabolism","/wiki/Signal_transduction","/wiki/Cellular_process","/wiki/Systems_biology","/wiki/Lyric_poetry","/wiki/Brigitte_Reimann","/wiki/Dresden","/wiki/Soviet_Union","/wiki/Second_World_War","/wiki/Dresden_University_of_Technology","/wiki/East_Germany","/wiki/Postdoctoral_research","/wiki/Charit%C3%A9","/wiki/Enzyme_kinetics","/wiki/Enzyme","/wiki/Metabolic_pathway","/wiki/Rate-limiting_step","/wiki/Tom_Rapoport","/wiki/Mathematical_model","/wiki/Glycolysis","/wiki/Red_blood_cell","/wiki/Humboldt_Prize","/wiki/Henrik_Kacser","/w/index.php?title=J.A._B&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Metabolic_control_analysis","/wiki/Metabolic_network","/wiki/Osmoregulation","/wiki/Signal_transduction","/wiki/Vesicular_transport","/wiki/Malaria_parasite","/wiki/Enzymatic_reaction","/wiki/Physical_chemistry","/w/index.php?title=Stefan_Schuster&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Honorary_degree","/wiki/University_of_Bordeaux","/w/index.php?title=Reinhart_Heinrich&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Reinhart_Heinrich&veaction=edit&section=1","http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.0030018","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.0030018","http://www2.hu-berlin.de/leibniz-sozietaet/archiv%20sb/088/13_heinrich.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7120/full/444700a.html","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2F444700a","http://www2.hu-berlin.de/biologie/theorybp/personal_homepages/heinrich_r/index.htm","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/23191070","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reinhart_Heinrich&oldid=544991724","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1946_births","/wiki/Category:2006_deaths","/wiki/Category:Dresden_University_of_Technology_alumni","/wiki/Category:German_biophysicists","/wiki/Category:Humboldt_University_of_Berlin_faculty","/wiki/Category:Systems_biologists","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_February_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Reinhart+Heinrich&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Reinhart+Heinrich","/wiki/Reinhart_Heinrich","/wiki/Talk:Reinhart_Heinrich","#","/wiki/Reinhart_Heinrich","/w/index.php?title=Reinhart_Heinrich&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Reinhart_Heinrich&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Reinhart_Heinrich&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured
