{"cursor":"1583","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Gas diffusion' refers to a surgical sterilization method for heat, moisture, or\npressure-sensitive items, with the exception of food, drugs, or liquids. This\nmethod is reliable and economically feasible for smaller loads and is often seen\nin hospitals, veterinarian practices, and medical device manufacturing practices\nwhere it is frequently used for non-autoclavable items.\n\nGas diffusion sterilization relies on the use of a bag containing an ampoule of\nliquid ethylene oxide (100% EtO) which, upon activation, evaporates and diffuses\nthrough the containing bag into a second bag containing the items to be\nsterilized. Once there, it sterilizes on contact given the proper temperature\n(50 degrees Celsius) and humidity.\n\nThe gas diffusion sterilization is a proprietary method developed by Andersen\nProducts in 1958 and subsequently used by the Anprolene (EPA registered in 1968)\nand EOGas sterilizers.\n\nInterchangeable names for this method are \"gas diffusion sterilization\", \"micro-\ndose sterilization\" or \"flexible chamber sterilization\" because of the use of a\nbag instead of a rigid sterilization chamber, and the fact that it uses under\n18g per sterilization load as opposed to the traditional use of tanks that\nweight several pounds in use by the conventional EtO sterilization chambers.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"gas_diffusion_sterilization","recorded":1376428463,"links":[],"instances":["microbiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical hygiene"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["sterilization","microbiology"]],"members":["sterilization"],"related":["Sterilization_(microbiology)","Moisture","Ethylene_oxide","Anprolene","EPA","EOGas","Flexible_chamber_sterilization"]}
