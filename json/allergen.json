{"cursor":"28869","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'allergen' is a type of antigen that produces an abnormally vigorous immune\nresponse in which the immune system fights off a perceived threat that would\notherwise be harmless to the body. In technical terms, an allergen is an antigen\ncapable of stimulating a type-I hypersensitivity reaction in atopic individuals\nthrough Immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses. Most humans mount\nsignificant Immunoglobulin E responses only as a defense against parasitic\ninfections. However, some individuals may respond to many common environmental\nantigens. This hereditary predisposition is called atopy. In atopic individuals,\nnon-parasitic antigens stimulate inappropriate IgE production, leading to type I\nhypersensitivity. Sensitivities vary widely from one person (or other animal) to\nanother. A very broad range of substances can be allergens to sensitive\nindividuals.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"allergen","recorded":1376429394,"links":[],"instances":["season","plant","fruit","poison"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immune system","Immunology","Allergology"],"headings":["Types of allergies","Fungal allergens","Common allergens","Seasonal allergies","See also","External links","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["nut","fruit"],["poison-ivy","plant"],["calyx","zoology#insects"],["venom","poison"],["spring","season"]],"members":["calyx","spring","nut","venom"],"related":["Antigen","Type-I_hypersensitivity","Atopy","Immunoglobulin_E","Antigen","Atopy","Type_I_hypersensitivity","Dust_mite","Pollen","Dander","Royal_jelly","Food_sensitivity","Peanut","Legume","Nut_(fruit)","Seafood","Shellfish","Food_and_Drug_Administration","European_Union","Urushiol","Poison-ivy_(plant)","Poison_oak","Urushiol-induced_contact_dermatitis","Wasp","Fire_ant","Bee","Penicillin","Latex","Anaphylaxis","Epinephrine","Basidiospores","Puffballs","Ganoderma","Pleurotus_ostreatus","Cladosporium","Calvatia_cyathiformis","Aspergillus","Alternaria","Penicillin","Fomes_pectinatis","Coprinus_comatus","Chitin","Blood_transfusion","Vaccine","Fel_d_1","Allergy_to_cats","Fur","Dander","Cockroach","Wool","Dust_mite","Drug_allergy","Penicillin","Sulfonamides","Salicylate","Fruit","Food_allergy","Celery","Celeriac","Maize","Maize","Egg_allergy","Egg_white","Fruit_allergy","Pumpkin","Legume","Bean","Pea","Peanut_allergy","Soybean","Milk_allergy","Seafood_allergy","Sesame","Soy_allergy","Nut_allergy","Pecan","Almond","Wheat_allergy","Insect_sting_allergy","Bee","Venom_(poison)","Wasp","Mosquito","Spore","Latex_allergy","Metal","Wood","Pollen","Hay_fever","Grass","Ryegrass","Timothy-grass","Weed","Ragweed","Plantago","Nettle","Artemisia_vulgaris","Chenopodium_album","Sorrel","Tree","Birch","Alder","Hazel","Hornbeam","Aesculus","Willow","Poplar","Platanus","Tilia","Olea","Ashe_juniper","Spring_(season)","Summer","Fall","Trees","Grasses","Oak","Elm","Maple","Cynodon_dactylon","Sneezing","Runny_nose","Allergic_conjunctivitis","Coughing","Wheezing","Appetite","Sinuses","Headaches","Ruslan_Medzhitov","Over-the-counter_medication","Antihistamines","Nasal_decongestants","Allergy_shots","Alternative_medicine","Pseudoephedrine","Benadryl","Tavist","Mouth","Constipation","Urination","Non-sedating_antihistamines","Cetirizine","Loratadine","Fexofenadine","Insomnia","Anxiety","Nasal_spray","Azelastine","Ipratropium","Contact_lenses","Immunotherapy","Petasites_hybridus","Urtica","Goldenseal","Asthma","Bioaerosol","Eczema","Eggshell_skull","Hypoallergenic","Immunodiagnostics","List_of_allergies","Nose_filter","Oral_allergy_syndrome","Toxin"]}
