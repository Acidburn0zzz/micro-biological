Reversing the order of combining gives the same result.\nDepending on context, we may consider a reflection a special case, where the\ntranslation vector is the zero vector.\n\nThe combination of a reflection in a line and a translation in a perpendicular\ndirection is a reflection in a parallel line. However, a glide reflection cannot\nbe reduced like that. Thus the effect of a reflection combined with any\ntranslation is a glide reflection, with as special case just a reflection. These\nare the two kinds of indirect isometries in 2D.\n\nFor example, there is an isometry consisting of the reflection on the x-axis,\nfollowed by translation of one unit parallel to it. In coordinates, it takes\n\n:(x, y) â (x + 1, −y).\n\nIt fixes a system of parallel lines.\n\nThe isometry group generated by just a glide reflection is an infinite\ncyclic group.\n\nCombining two equal glide reflections gives a pure translation with a\ntranslation vector that is twice that of the glide reflection, so the even\npowers of the glide reflection form a translation group.\n\nIn the case of 'glide reflection symmetry', the symmetry group of an object\ncontains a glide reflection, and hence the group generated by it. If that is all\nit contains, this type is frieze group nr. 2.\n\nExample pattern with this symmetry group:\n +         + +++ +++ +++ + Frieze group nr. 6 (glide-reflections, translations\n           and rotations) is generated by a glide reflection and a rotation\n           about a point on the line of reflection. It is isomorphic to a semi-\n           direct product of 'Z' and C 2.\n\nExample pattern with this symmetry group:\n  +   + + +\n + + + + +\n\nFor any symmetry group containing some glide reflection symmetry, the\ntranslation vector of any glide reflection is one half of an element of the\ntranslation group. If the translation vector of a glide reflection is\nitself an element of the translation group, then the corresponding glide\nreflection symmetry reduces to a combination of reflection symmetry and\ntranslational symmetry.\n\nGlide reflection symmetry with respect to two parallel lines with the same\ntranslation implies that there is also translational symmetry in the direction\nperpendicular to these lines, with a translation distance which is twice the\ndistance between glide reflection lines. This corresponds to wallpaper group pg;\nwith additional symmetry it occurs also in pmg, pgg and p4g.\n\nIf there are also true reflection lines in the same direction then they are\nevenly spaced between the glide reflection lines. A glide reflection line\nparallel to a true reflection line already implies this situation. This\ncorresponds to wallpaper group cm. The translational symmetry is given by\noblique translation vectors from one point on a true reflection line to two\npoints on the next, supporting a rhombus with the true reflection line as one\nof the diagonals. With additional symmetry it occurs also in cmm, p3m1, p31m,\np4m and p6m.\n\nIn 3D the glide reflection is called a '[[glide plane]]'. It is a reflection in\na plane combined with a translation parallel to the plane.\n\nGlide symmetry can be observed in nature among certain fossils of the Ediacara\nbiota; the machaeridians; and certain palaeoscolecid worms.\n","linknr":56,"url":"glide_symmetry","recorded":1376428775,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Glide_reflection&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Glide_reflection&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glide_reflection","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Glide_symmetry&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Glide_reflection.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Glide_reflection.svg/300px-Glide_reflection.svg.png","/wiki/File:Glide_reflection.svg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Geometry","/wiki/Isometry","/wiki/Euclidean_plane","/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics)","/wiki/Translation_(geometry)","/wiki/Euclidean_group#Overview_of_isometries_in_up_to_three_dimensions","/wiki/Isometry_group","/wiki/Cyclic_group","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Symmetry_group","/wiki/Frieze_group","/wiki/Semi-direct_product","/wiki/Reflection_symmetry","/wiki/Translational_symmetry","/wiki/Wallpaper_group","/wiki/Rhombus","/wiki/Glide_plane","/wiki/Ediacara_biota","/wiki/Machaeridian","/wiki/Palaeoscolecid","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Glide_reflection&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Glide_reflection&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life","/wiki/Spaceship_(cellular_automaton)","/wiki/Glider_(Conway%27s_Life)","/w/index.php?title=Glide_reflection&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Glide_reflection&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307%2F2413615","/wiki/JSTOR","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2413615","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Cite_doi/10.2307.2F2413615&action=edit&editintro=Template:Cite_doi/editintro2","/w/index.php?title=Glide_reflection&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Glide_reflection&veaction=edit&section=3"],"instances":["cellular_automaton","geometry","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Functions and mappings","Euclidean symmetries","Transformation (function)"],"headings":["Glide reflection in cellular automata","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Glide_reflection.svg/300px-Glide_reflection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png"],"tags":[["reflection","mathematics"],["translation","geometry"],["spaceship","cellular_automaton"],["glider","conway's_life"]],"members":["spaceship","glider","translation","reflection"],"related":["Geometry","Isometry","Euclidean_plane","Reflection_(mathematics)","Translation_(geometry)","Isometry_group","Cyclic_group","Symmetry_group","Frieze_group","Semi-direct_product","Reflection_symmetry","Translational_symmetry","Wallpaper_group","Rhombus","Ediacara_biota","Machaeridian","Palaeoscolecid","Conway's_Game_of_Life","Spaceship_(cellular_automaton)","Glider_(Conway's_Life)","Cut-the-knot"]}
