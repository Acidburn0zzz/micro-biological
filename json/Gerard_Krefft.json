{"cursor":"5517","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Johann Ludwig (Louis) Gerard Krefft' (17 February 1830 â 19 February 1881),\none of Australia's first and greatest zoologists and palaeontologists. In\naddition to many scientific papers, his books include The Snakes of\nAustralia, A Catalogue of the Minerals and Rocks in the Australian Museum and\nA Short Guide to the Australian Fossil Remains in the Australian Museum. He\npublished the scientific description of the Queensland Lungfish, a\nfascinating \"living fossil\".\n\nKrefft was born in the Duchy of Brunswick (now part of Germany) the son of\nWilliam Krefft, confectioner, and his wife Johanna, nÃ©e Buschhoff. G. P. Whitley, Martha Rutledge,\n'[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050051b.htm Krefft, Johann Ludwig\nGerard (Louis) (1830 - 1881)]', [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume\n5, MUP, 1974, pp 42-44. Retrieved 5 Sep 2009 He was educated at St\nMartin's College, Brunswick, and as a youth was interested in art\nand wished to study painting. He was, however, placed in a mercantile house and\nabout 1850 emigrated to New York. Krefft arrived in Australia in November 1852\nand worked in the Victorian goldfields for some years before joining William\nBlandowski's explorations on the Murray River and Darling River in 1856-1857.\n\nKrefft visited Germany in 1858 following the death of his father. Krefft arrived\nin Sydney, New South Wales in 1860 and was appointed Assistant Curator of the\nAustralian Museum on the recommendation of Governor Sir William Denison. In 1864 he was appointed Director. In 1864 he published a Catalogue\nof Mammalia in the Collection of the Australian Museum, and in 1865, as a\npamphlet, Two Papers on the Vertebrata of the Lower Murray and Darling and on\nthe Snakes of Sydney. These papers had been read before the Philosophical\nSociety of New South Wales and, though the title did not show it, a third paper\non the Aborigines of the Lower Murray and Darling was included in the\npublication. In 1869 Krefft brought out The Snakes of Australia and in 1871 The\nMammals of Australia, both with plates by Helena Scott and Harriet Scott. His\nCatalogue of the Minerals and Rocks in the Collection of the Australian Museum\nwas published in 1873.\n\nKrefft was fired in 1874. He was carried in his chair to the door of the Museum\nand thrown into the street. He had fallen foul of the Trustees, William John\nMacleay in particular, because he had accused them of using the museum's\nresources to augment private collections. They responded by accusing\nhim of drunkenness, falsifying attendance records and even allowing the sale of\ndirty postcards. He subsequently brought an action against one of the trustees\nand obtained a verdict for Â£250. The judge held that Krefft was a superior\nofficer under government, and that no one had power to remove him but the\ngovernor with the advice of the executive council. Subsequently parliament\npassed a vote of Â£1000 to be applied in satisfaction of Krefft's claims. In 1877\nhe began the publication of Krefft's Nature in Australia, a popular journal for\nthe discussion of questions of natural history, but it quickly ceased\npublication. Krefft died on 19 February 1881 from congestion of the lungs, he\nwas buried in the churchyard of St Jude's Church of England, Randwick. He was\nsurvived by his wife Annie, nÃ©e McPhail, whom he had married on 6 February 1869,\nand two sons.\n\nKrefft was a member of many scientific societies, and contributed papers to the\nProceedings of the Zoological Society of London and other scientific and popular\njournals. Some of these were printed separately as pamphlets.\n","linknr":159,"url":"Gerard_Krefft","recorded":1376425315,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Gerard_Krefft&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gerard_Krefft&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Krefft","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources","/wiki/Talk:Gerard_Krefft#.23","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gerard_Krefft&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/File:Krefft_Gerard_1830-1881.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Krefft_Gerard_1830-1881.png/220px-Krefft_Gerard_1830-1881.png","/wiki/File:Krefft_Gerard_1830-1881.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Zoology","/wiki/Paleontology","/wiki/Queensland","/wiki/Lungfish","/wiki/Fossil","/wiki/Duchy_of_Brunswick","/wiki/Germany","#cite_note-ADB-1","/wiki/Braunschweig","#cite_note-ADB-1","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/Victoria,_Australia","/wiki/William_Blandowski","/wiki/Blandowski_Expedition","/wiki/Murray_River","/wiki/Darling_River","/wiki/Sydney","/wiki/New_South_Wales","/wiki/Australian_Museum","/wiki/William_Denison","#cite_note-ADB-1","/wiki/Helena_Scott","/wiki/Harriet_Morgan","/wiki/William_John_Macleay","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Randwick,_New_South_Wales","#cite_note-ADB-1","/w/index.php?title=Gerard_Krefft&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Gerard_Krefft&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-ADB_1-0","#cite_ref-ADB_1-1","#cite_ref-ADB_1-2","#cite_ref-ADB_1-3","http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050051b.htm","/wiki/Australian_Dictionary_of_Biography","/wiki/Melbourne_University_Press","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.toxicon.2006.07.016","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16999982","/wiki/Percival_Serle","http://gutenberg.net.au/dictbiog/0-dict-biogI-K.html#krefft1","/wiki/Dictionary_of_Australian_Biography","/w/index.php?title=Gerard_Krefft&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Gerard_Krefft&veaction=edit&section=2","http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Search/Home?lookfor=Gerard+Krefft","/wiki/Authority_control","http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-nb2007-028367","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/42590955","/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nb2007028367","/wiki/International_Standard_Name_Identifier","http://isni-url.oclc.nl/isni/000000006676897X","/wiki/Integrated_Authority_File","http://d-nb.info/gnd/116514159","/wiki/Union_List_of_Artist_Names","http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=&role=&nation=&subjectid=500100528","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gerard_Krefft&oldid=568311022","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1830_births","/wiki/Category:1881_deaths","/wiki/Category:Australian_curators","/wiki/Category:Australian_zoologists","/wiki/Category:Australian_people_of_German_descent","/wiki/Category:People_from_Braunschweig","/wiki/Category:People_from_Brunswick","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_February_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_February_2011","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_LCCN_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_ISNI_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_GND_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_ULAN_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gerard+Krefft&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gerard+Krefft","/wiki/Gerard_Krefft","/wiki/Talk:Gerard_Krefft","#","/wiki/Gerard_Krefft","/w/index.php?title=Gerard_Krefft&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gerard_Krefft&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gerard_Krefft&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bi
