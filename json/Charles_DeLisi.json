Prior to moving to Boston University, he was Professor and Chair\nof Biomathematical Sciences and Professor of Molecular Biology at the Mount\nSinai School of Medicine (1987â1989), Director of the United States Department\nof Energy's Health and Environmental Research Programs (1985â1987), Section\nChief at National Institutes of Health (1975â1985), and Theoretical Division\nStaff Scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory (1972â1975).\n\nIn 1999 he initiated the Boston University graduate program in Bioinformatics,\nwhich now includes approximately 120 students and 50 faculty from across the\nuniversity.\n\nDeLisi was an early champion of the controversial idea that in cell biology,\njust as in the physical sciences, the mathematical formulation of concepts could\npredict phenomena that would not otherwise be apparent, and could thereby drive\nexperimental research in new directions. The approach is seen in a number of\ninvestigations. His 1979 paper DeLisi, C.: Physical-Chemical and Biological\nImplications of Receptor Clustering. In DeLisi, C., and Blumenthal, R. (Ed.):\nPhysical Chemical Aspects of Cell Surface Events in Cellular Regulation. New\nYork, Elsevier, North Holland, 1979. predicted, several years in advance\nof experimental demonstration, that the signal generated when nerve growth\nfactor binds its plasma membrane receptor is transduced by receptor\ndimerization.\n\nIn immunology, DeLisi was a strong proponent of the controversial hypothesis\nthat the response of T-cells to antigenic stimulation involves formation of a\nternary complex. Predictions based on the mathematical formulation of that idea,\nthe amphipathic hypothesis, DeLisi, C., and Berzofsky, J. T Cell Antigenic\nSites are Amphipathic Structures, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 82: 7048-7052,\n1985. Cornette, J, Berzofsky, J. Margalit H. and DeLisi, C. Periodic\nVariation in Side Chain Polarities of T Cell Antigenic Peptides Correlates with\nTheir Structure and Activity, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 8368-8372, 1995.\nprovided strong support for what was ultimately demonstrated conclusively by X-\nray crystallogrphy. The mathematical methods, developed initially with Jay\nBerzofsky, were subsequently extended and modified by many others, presaging the\nnow widely used bioinformatic approaches to guide the design of peptide\nvaccines.

Bill Kwok, editor, Methods 29 (2003) 289â298.\n\nAt the same time, the Section on Theoretical Immunology (STI), which DeLisi\nfounded several years earlier at the NIH, had introduced the use of supervised\nlearning algorithms for the identification of functional regions in\nDNA Nakata, K., Kanehisa, M., and DeLisi, C.: Prediction of Splice Junctions\nin m RNA Sequences, Nucleic Acids Research, 13, 5327-5340, 1985 and\nproteins. Klein, P., Kanehisa, M. and DeLisi, C.: The Detection and\nClassification of Membrane Spanning Proteins, Biochemica et Biophysica Acta,\n815, 468, 1985 The first database integrating DNA and protein sequences\nwith analytical tools Kanehisa, M., Klein, P., Greif, P. and DeLisi, C.:\nComputer Analysis and Structure Prediction of Nucleic Acids and Protein. Nucleic\nAcids Research 12: 417-428, 1984. was developed in collaboration with\nMinoru Kanehisa, who was then a Visiting Fellow at STI.\n\nIn 1985, as Director of the U.S. Department of Energyâs (DOE) Health and\nEnvironmental Research Programs, DeLisi and his advisors proposed, planned and\ndefended before the White House Office of Management and Budget and the\nCongress, the Human Genome Project. The proposal created a storm of controversy,\nbut was included in President Ronald Reaganâs FY 1987 budget submission to the\nCongress, and subsequently passed both the House and the Senate, the latter with\nthe essential support of Senator Pete Domenici (R, NM).\n\nIn the spring of 1987, shortly before leaving the DOE, DeLisi established an\nethical studies component of the Project. Robert Cooke-Deegan, Gene Wars, p\n262, W. H. Norton, New York, 1994 The goal was to set aside 3-5% of the\nfunding in order to engage the best minds in the humanities and social sciences\nto develop a body of thought that would inform decisions about the development\nand deployment of the radically new technologies destined to emerge from the\ncompletion of the Project. In taking this step DeLisi was likely influenced by\nthe fact that he was working for an agency that provided the vast majority of\nthe Nationâs nuclear physics budget, and the awareness that the consequences of\nthe rapid development of nucelar energy some four decades earlier continued to\nplague the planet.\n\nIn addition to the technical and scientific advances engendered by the Human\nGenome Project, it and its progeny have had a profound effect on the sociology\nand culture of cell biology. The computer science community in particular moved\nwith extraordinary dexterity into cell biology, transforming the field and\ncreating a record of discovery destined to provide material for a remarkable\nstory in the sociology of late 20th and early 21st Century science.\nComputational and mathematical methods are now widely viewed as central to\nprogress in cell biology, a change that is forcing even the most conservative\nuniversities to respond to a new paradigm in biological education. C DeLisi,\nA Time to Abandon Hedgehogs, Genome Technology, 2001\n\nCommemorating the significance of the Human Genome Project, the DOE installed a\nbronze plaque outside room F-202 at its Germantown, Maryland facility. The\nplaque reads, âFROM THIS ROOM THE HUMAN GENOME PROJECT EVOLVED FROM A MERE\nCONCEPT TO A REVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH PROGRAM THROUGH THE VISION AND DETERMINATION\nOF DR. CHARLES DELISI ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF ENERGY RESEARCH FOR HEALTH AND\nENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH 1985 TO 1987.â\n\nDeLisi is recipient of numerous awards including the Presidential Citizens\nMedal, awarded to him by President Clinton for his seminal role in initiating\nthe Human Genome Project.
