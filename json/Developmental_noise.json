{"cursor":"8399","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Developmental noise' is a concept within developmental biology in which the\nphenotype varies between individuals even though both the genotypes and the\nenvironmental factors are the same for all of them. Contributing\nfactors include stochastic gene expression and other sources of cellular\nnoise.\n\n;Definition\n\nAlthough organisms within a species share very similar genes, similar\nenvironments and similar developmental history, each individual organism can\ndevelop differences due to noise in signaling and signal interpretation. This\ndevelopmental noise may help individual gain ability to adapt to environment and\ncan contribute to unique patterns of development in each individual.\nHuman fingerprints provide a well-known example; the fingerprints differ even\nbetween genetically identical human twins.\n\n;Use of noise in biology\n\nThe developmental noise may help individual gain ability to adapt to\nenvironment. Biological systems display both variation and\nrobustness. Natural variation within a population is in large part\ngenetically determined, but variation due to noise may contribute to rapid\nresponse by an individual to changes in the environment. This variation can have\nevolutionary tuning that contributes to optimal fitness of population. In\nsupport of this idea, it is shown that bacteria can switch stochastically into a\n\"persistent\" state which have slow growth coupled with an ability to survive\nantibiotic treatment. In another study, itâs shown that most of the\nnoisy proteins were associated with the stress response. When proteins are\nexpress in small quantities, the expression of more noisy proteins will be more\ninfluenced by noises which come from environmental context. The noises include\nextrinsic noise which is the variation in cell-to-cell expression level of\nprotein, and intrinsic noise which is the variation of inherent stochastic\nnature in protein expression. Moreover, noisy genes were associated\nwith a distinct promoter architecture, including the prevalence of TATA boxes,\nconsistent with the theoretical predictions that noise is greatly inï¬uenced by\nthe logic of the transcriptional process itself and, in particular, the\ntransition from closed to open chromatin.\n\nThe developmental noise can contribute to unique patterns of development in each\nindividual as well. During development of a complex organ, variability in gene\nexpression may be required to contribute to differentiation of multiple cell\ntypes from cells that have equivalent potential. For example, the patterning of\nthe adult fly eye relies on multiple alternative choices of differentiation\npathways within an apparently homogeneous field of cells. The facets (ommatidia)\nin fly eye occur as two types, designated pale and yellow, as defined by the\nparticular types of rhodopsin photopigments expressed in the two inner\nphotoreceptor cells. In flies\ncarrying mutations in the gene spineless, all ommatidia show the pale fate,\nwhile over expression of spineless induces the yellow fate. The final pattern of\nommatidia is determined by stochastic variation in expression of this single\ntranscription factor Spineless.\n\n;Developmental noise in plant\n\nThe majority of study on developmental noise has focused on animals, but there\nare also examples from plants. In one early study, Roy made thousands of\nobservations on petal numbers as well as on leaf tooth numbers. He observed a\nhigh degree of variability in both traits. After analyzing his data, he could\nnot conclude that the variability was caused by environmental effect. Another\nexample of noise in plants is lateral root behavior. People found that the\ngrowth of lateral root is unpredictable in genetically identical plants which\ngrow in the same environment. One more example of seed germination may\nillustrate the benefit of developmental noise in plants. Stochasticity in the\ntiming of germination ensures that at least a fraction of the progeny will\nsurvive to reproduce.\n\n;Noise and robustness\n\nThough stochastic variations in cell behaviors may be beneficial, most\nbiological systems need to maintain a reliable output without unpredictable\nvariations. This ability to buffer variations generated by molecular noise,\ngenetic polymorphism, or environmental ï¬uctuations is termed robustness.\n\nFor example, in the development of the repeating blocks of somites in the\nmesoderm of vertebrate animals, even though the biological system may be subject\nto a noisy environment, the segmentation clock maintains periodic gene\nexpression through coupled oscillators, in which synchronous oscillation of\nneighbors is maintained through mutual coupling. This mechanism enables embryos\nto maintain a constant segregation of somites, despite the noise imposed by the\nhigh level mitosis required for continued growth.\n\n;Further study\n\nThe source, consequence, and the control of noise are major questions in study\nof developmental noise. Recent studies suggest that this noise has multiple\nsources, including the stochastic or inherently random nature of the biochemical\nreactions of gene expression. But the detailed mechanisms are still unclear and\nthe contributions of factors such as microRNAs, whose existence was first\ndiscovered in the 1990, remain unclear. For example, one recent study showed\nthat microRNA can serve different roles, from using noise to throw a\ndevelopmental switch to buffering the consequences of noise in order to confer\nrobustness to environmental perturbation. Thus, much\nwork remains to be done in understanding the significance, control and\nmechanisms of developmental noise.\n","linknr":129,"url":"Developmental_noise","recorded":1376417914,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Developmental_noise&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Developmental_noise&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_noise","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Developmental_biology","/wiki/Phenotype","/wiki/Genotype","/wiki/Environmental_factor","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Cellular_noise","#cite_note-pmid16760970-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-Wernet-8","#cite_note-Forde-9","#cite_note-Wernet-8","#cite_note-Forde-9","#cite_note-Ishimatsu-10","#cite_note-Ishimatsu-10","/w/index.php?title=Developmental_noise&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Developmental_noise&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307%2F2410259","/wiki/JSTOR","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2410259","#cite_ref-pmid16760970_2-0","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fnature04861","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16760970","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Science_(journal)","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.1105891","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.molcel.2007.11.013","#cite_ref-5","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1534%2Fgenetics.104.035352","#cite_ref-6","http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/9472/","#cite_ref-7","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.molcel.2006.11.003","#cite_ref-Wernet_8-0","#cite_ref-Wernet_8-1","/wiki/Nature_(journal)","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fnature04615","#cite_ref-Forde_9-0","#cite_ref-Forde_9-1","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Fjxb%2Ferp265","#cite_ref-Ishimatsu_10-0","#cite_ref-Ishimatsu_10-1","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fdvdy.21139","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Developmental_noise&oldid=552906690","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Classical_genetics","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Developmental+noise&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Developmental+noise","/wiki/Developmental_noise","/wiki/Talk:Developmental_noise","#","/wiki/Developmental_noise","/w/index.php?title=Developmental_noise&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Developmental_noise&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Developmental_noise&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Developmental_noise","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Developmental_noise","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Developmental_noise&oldid=552906690","/w/index.php?title=Developmental_noise&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5266808","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Developmental_noise&id=552906690","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Developmental+noise","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Developmental+noise&oldid=552906690&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Developmental_noise&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5266808#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wik
