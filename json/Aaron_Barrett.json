Prior to forming with Reel\nBig Fish, Barrett played trombone in another ska-punk act, The Scholars, along\nwith future Reel Big Fish bandmates Scott Klopfenstein and Grant Barry. More\nrecently he formed The Forces of Evil with former members of Jeffries Fan Club,\nThe Scholars and Lone Raspberry. The Forces of Evil sounded similar to Barrett's\nmain band, although lyrically they were much more pessimistic. The Forces Of\nEvil ceased touring and playing in early 2005, although several members have\ngone on to play with Reel Big Fish.\n\nBarrett is also featured in [[Serious Awesomeness]], a DVD by The Aquabats,\ninterviewing attendees of an Aquabats show outside of The Glass House in Pomona,\nCalifornia, calling himself \"Joe Famous\" and is also seen briefly on stage with\nthe band. He made a cameo appearance in the music video for \"Come Back Home\" by\nSuburban Legends in an Elvis costume and a cameo appearance in the music video\nfor \"I'm OK, You're OK\" by MxPx as a doughnut shop employee. Aaron has been\ndubbed as \"The sexiest man of ska in 2009\".\n\nBarrett gained notoriety in 2004 when he appeared onstage with Reel Big Fish at\na concert in Syracuse, apparently intoxicated. After around 45 minutes, Barrett\nflew into a frenzy mid-song, destroying equipment onstage and leaving the venue.\nThe show was reviewed by [http://www.punknews.org/review/3468 Punknews.org].\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Aaron_Barrett","recorded":1376424711,"links":[],"instances":["guitar","band","suburban_legends_album","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1974 births","Living people","American male singers","American punk rock guitarists","American punk rock singers","American singer-songwriters","American ska guitarists","American ska singers","American trombonists","Musicians from California","People from San Bernardino County, California"],"headings":["Stage equipment","Other projects","Personal life","Discography","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["organ","music"],["the_scholars","band"],["the_scholars","band"],["the_scholars","band"],["les_paul","guitar"],["day_job","suburban_legends_album"],["the_scholars","band"]],"members":["les_paul","the_scholars","day_job","organ"],"related":["Warped_Tour","Singing","Guitar","Trombone","Synthesizer","Organ_(music)","Celesta","Slide_guitar","Third_wave_ska","Ska_punk","Alternative_rock","Punk_rock","Musician","Vocalist","Songwriter","Record_producer","Reel_Big_Fish","The_Scholars_(band)","The_Forces_Of_Evil","Reel_Big_Fish","The_Scholars_(band)","Scott_Klopfenstein","Grant_Barry","The_Forces_of_Evil","Jeffries_Fan_Club","The_Scholars_(band)","Lone_Raspberry","The_Aquabats","Pomona,_California","California","Suburban_Legends","MxPx","Drunkenness","Brian_Klemm","Suburban_Legends","Gordon_Smith_Guitars","Les_Paul_(guitar)","Silhouette","The_Aquabats!","Chase_Long_Beach","Suburban_Legends","Big_D_and_the_Kids_Table","Brian_Klemm","Day_Job_(Suburban_Legends_album)","Appendectomy","Chase_Long_Beach","The_Forces_of_Evil","The_Scholars_(band)","Zolof_the_Rock_&_Roll_Destroyer","Rave_Master"]}
