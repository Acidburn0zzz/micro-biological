{"cursor":"4703","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'ADEPD' is the acronym for 'Atlantic Data Base for Exchange Processes at the\nDeep Sea Floor' (MAS3-CT97-0126) which was a marine research project funded by\nthe EU from 1998 to 2000 as part of MAST III (Marine Science and Technology\nProgramme). The project was coordinated by Prof. Dr. Karin Lochte at the Leibniz\nInstitute for Baltic Sea Research, WarnemÃ¼nde with contributions of ten European\npartners and one institute from the US.\n\nAim of the ADEPD project was to build up a joint data base for deep sea\nbiological and geochemical data from a variety of sources and to conduct a\npreliminary geographical analysis of these data. Emphasis was on the North\nAtlantic, since from this area most data are available and it is the most\nperturbed deep sea region due to human activities. 1775 published and\nunpublished data sets were collected in two years. This was the first project\nwhich has compiled a data base from existing deep sea data, long-term archived\nand accessible to the scientific community.\n\nEvaluation of the data collection showed that data are clustered in some well\ninvestigated areas of the Atlantic, but large regions are devoid of data like\nthe Mid Atlantic Ridge, parts of the South Atlantic and Southern Ocean. In\nparticular biological data from the deep sea are much more scarce than\ngeochemical ones, since many biological data from past investigations are not\naccessible in a suitable form at present. Most deep sea research projects did\nnot carry out geochemical and biological studies at the same lcoations.\nTherefor, statistical comparisons between biological and geochemical data are\nstill difficult despite the high total amount of data gathered. Different\nmethods employed for the determination of one variable further complicate the\nmatter. One of the major achievements of ADEP was to convert different\nmeasurements to common units. This allowed to investigate relationships between\ndifferent chemical measurements, groups of organisms and turnover rates.\n\nTwo very different approaches to estimate the total turnover of organic carbon\nor oxygen (respiration) at the deep sea floor gave very similar results.\nRegional differences in both assessments point to methodological shortcomings by\none or the other method and to gaps in data coverage. While estimates agreed\nwell in central Atlantic regions, fairly large discrepancies were found at the\ncontinental margins. This indicated that there was still insufficient knowledge\nabout transport processes and biological turnover of organic carbon along\ncontinental margins.\n\nThe following recommendations for future research were given on the basis of the\nADEPD results:\n* It is most important to secure deep sea biological data from so far\n  inaccessible sources and to collate them in a data information system which\n  guarantees long-term stewardship and public access.\n* Biological and geochemical studies were mostly carried out separately which\n  seems to be a systematic, scientific pattern and poses a problem in deep sea\n  research. Interdisciplinary studies are essential to better understand of deep\n  sea processes.\n* The largest differences in estimates of oxygen fluxes at the sea floor are\n  found at continental margins which export large amounts of organic carbon to\n  the deep sea. The knowledge of transport and biological utilization at the\n  continental margins need further attention.\n","linknr":98,"url":"ADEPD","recorded":1376415446,"links":["/w/index.php?title=ADEPD&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=ADEPD&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADEPD","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/EU","/wiki/Karin_Lochte","/wiki/Leibniz_Institute_for_Baltic_Sea_Research","/wiki/Deep_sea","/wiki/Biology","/wiki/Geochemistry","/wiki/Atlantic","/wiki/Southern_Ocean","/wiki/Total_organic_carbon","/wiki/Continental_margin","/w/index.php?title=ADEPD&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=ADEPD&veaction=edit&section=1","http://www.pangaea.de/search?q=project:adepd","/wiki/PANGAEA_(data_library)","http://hdl.handle.net/10013/epic.32910.d001","/w/index.php?title=ADEPD&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=ADEPD&veaction=edit&section=2","http://www.io-warnemuende.de/","http://www.awi.de/","http://www.nerc-oban.ac.uk/","http://www.geo.uni-bremen.de/page.php?pageid=2&langid=EN","http://www.ifm-geomar.de/","http://www.ifremer.fr/anglais","http://www.mpi-bremen.de/","http://www.nioz.nl//","http://www.ocean.ru/eng/","http://www.skio.peachnet.edu/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ADEPD&oldid=356658848","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Marine_biology","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=ADEPD&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=ADEPD","/wiki/ADEPD","/w/index.php?title=Talk:ADEPD&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/ADEPD","/w/index.php?title=ADEPD&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=ADEPD&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=ADEPD&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/ADEPD","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/ADEPD","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=ADEPD&oldid=356658848","/w/index.php?title=ADEPD&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4651101","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=ADEPD&id=356658848","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=ADEPD","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=ADEPD&oldid=356658848&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=ADEPD&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4651101#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADEPD","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["data_library"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Marine
