The state includes the island of\nTasmania, the 26th largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334\nislands. The state has a population of 507,626 (), of whom almost\nhalf reside in the greater Hobart precinct. Tasmania's area is , of which the\nmain island covers\n. [http://www.brandtasmania.com/show.php?ACT=Public&menu_code=100.1100\n'Facts About Tasmania'] Brand Tasmania.com. Retrieved 15 June 2009.\n\nTasmania is promoted as the natural state, the \"Island of\nInspiration\", and A World Apart, Not A World Away owing to its large\nand relatively unspoiled natural environment. Almost 45% of Tasmania lies in\nreserves, national parks and World Heritage Sites. The island is long\nfrom its northernmost to its southernmost points, and from west to east.\n\nThe state capital and largest city is Hobart, which encompasses the local\ngovernment areas of City of Hobart, City of Glenorchy, and City of Clarence,\nwhile the satellite town of Kingston (part of the Municipality of Kingborough)\nis generally included in the Greater Hobart area.\n\nThe northernmost terrestrial point of the state of Tasmania is Boundary Islet, a\nnature reserve in Bass Strait which, due to a quirk of history, is shared with\nthe state of Victoria.\n\nThe subantarctic Macquarie Island and its surrounding islands are also under the\nadministration of Tasmania as a nature reserve and part of the Huon Valley\nCouncil local government area. The Bishop and Clerk Islets, about 37 km south of\nMacquarie Island, are the southernmost terrestrial point of the state of\nTasmania, and the southernmost internationally recognised land in Australia.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Tasmania","recorded":1376418415,"links":[],"instances":["food","tasmania","tennis","tasmania","marsupialia","australia","australia","tasmania","metal_band","colonist","tasmania","art_collector","australia","tasmania","racing_driver","australian_band","tasmania","tasmania","tasmania","artist","2009","tasmania","tasmania","politician","1798","tasmanian_lutenist","composer","australia_season_1","australia","agriculture","tasmania","australia","whaler","woodchopper"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Former
