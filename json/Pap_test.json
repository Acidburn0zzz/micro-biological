Unusual findings are often followed up by more\nsensitive diagnostic procedures, and, if warranted, interventions that aim to\nprevent progression to cervical cancer. The test was invented by and named after\nthe prominent Greek doctor Georgios Papanikolaou.\n\nIn taking a Pap smear, a speculum is used to open the vaginal canal and allow\nthe collection of cells from the outer opening of the cervix of the uterus and\nthe endocervix. The cells are examined under a microscope to look for\nabnormalities. The test aims to detect potentially pre-cancerous changes (called\ncervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cervical dysplasia), which are\nusually caused by sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses. The test remains\nan effective, widely used method for early detection of pre-cancer and cervical\ncancer. The test may also detect infections and abnormalities in the endocervix\nand endometrium.\n\nIn general, in countries where Pap smear screening is routine, it is recommended\nthat females who have had sex seek regular Pap smear testing. Guidelines on\nfrequency vary from every three to five years. American Cancer Society. (2010).

If results are abnormal, and depending on the\nnature of the abnormality, the test may need to be repeated in six to twelve\nmonths. If the abnormality requires closer scrutiny, the\npatient may be referred for detailed inspection of the cervix by colposcopy. The\npatient may also be referred for HPV DNA testing, which can serve as an adjunct\nto Pap testing. Additional biomarkers which may be applied as ancillary test\nwith Pap test are evolving.
