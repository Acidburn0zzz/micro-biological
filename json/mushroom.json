{"cursor":"39449","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'', commonly known as \"fly agaric\"]] A 'mushroom' (or 'toadstool') is the\nfleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground\non soil or on its food source. The standard for the name \"mushroom\" is the\ncultivated white button mushroom, [[Agaricus bisporus]]; hence the word\n\"mushroom\" is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes)\nthat have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing. lamella) or\npores on the underside of the cap.\n\n\"Mushroom\" describes a variety of gilled fungi, with or without stems, and the\nterm is used even more generally, to describe both the fleshy fruiting bodies of\nsome Ascomycota and the woody or leathery fruiting bodies of some Basidiomycota,\ndepending upon the context of the word.\n\nForms deviating from the standard morphology usually have more specific names,\nsuch as \"puffball\", \"stinkhorn\", and \"morel\", and gilled mushrooms themselves\nare often called \"agarics\" in reference to their similarity to [[Agaricus]] or\ntheir place Agaricales. By extension, the term \"mushroom\" can also designate the\nentire fungus when in culture; the thallus (called a mycelium) of species\nforming the fruiting bodies called mushrooms; or the species itself.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"mushroom","recorded":1376418388,"links":[],"instances":["biology","mycology","biology","food","biology","fungi","mycology","mycology","chemistry","mycology","tissue","mycology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fungi","Non-timber forest products"],"headings":["Identification","Classification","Etymology","Morphology","Growth","Nutrition","Human use","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["sporocarp","fungi"],["stipe","mycology"],["pileus","mycology"],["lamella","mycology"],["morphology","biology"],["thallus","tissue"],["lamella","mycology"],["classification","biology"],["taxonomy","biology"],["substrate","biology"],["volva","mycology"],["stipe","mycology"],["lamella","mycology"],["annulus","mycology"],["cell","biology"],["garnish","food"],["heavy_metal","chemistry"]],"members":["substrate","annulus","taxonomy","garnish","morphology","sporocarp","volva","stipe","heavy_metal","lamella","thallus","pileus","classification","cell"],"related":["Spore","Sporocarp_(fungi)","Fungus","Food","Basidiomycota","Agaricomycetes","Stipe_(mycology)","Pileus_(mycology)","Lamella_(mycology)","Ascomycota","Basidiomycota","Morphology_(biology)","Puffball","Stinkhorn","Morel","Agaric","Agaricales","Thallus_(tissue)","Mycelium","Macroscopic","Basidiomycetes","Basidiospore","Basidia","Spore_print","Medieval","Victorian_era","Allergens","Chemical_test","Genus","Species","Lamella_(mycology)","Polypore","Agaricales","Type_genus","Molecular_phylogenetics","Classification_(biology)","Agaricomycetes","Cantharellus","Cantharellales","Gomphales","Russulales","Polyporales","Gloeophyllales","Hymenochaetales","Shiitake","Enoki","Oyster_mushrooms","Fly_agaric","Amanita","Magic_mushrooms","Volvariella","Coprinus_comatus","Lobster_mushroom","Parasite","Ascomycete","Bolete","Hericium_erinaceus","Tooth_fungus","Polypore","Puffball","Jelly_fungi","Coral_fungi","Bracket_fungus","Stinkhorn","Cup_fungus","Macroscopic","Taxonomy_(biology)","Gnome","Dutch_language","German_language","Panther_cap","German_language","Cognate","Toad","Cane_toad","Phono-semantic_matching","England","Superstition","United_States","Australia","Primordium","Substrate_(biology)","Mycelium","Hypha","Universal_veil","Volva_(mycology)","Stipe_(mycology)","Partial_veil","Lamella_(mycology)","Spore","Annulus_(mycology)","Puffball","Truffles","Jelly_fungus","Geastrales","Nidulariaceae","Phase_contrast_microscopy","Hymenium","Bolete","Ascus","Discomycetes","Cup_fungi","Morel","Pyrenomycetes","Perithecium","Electron_microscopy","Sterigmata","Basidium","Gasteromycetes","Gleba","Stinkhorn","Paraphyses","Cystidia","Chemical_tests_in_mushroom_identification","Germ_pore","Paris","English_language","Agaricus_bisporus","Field_mushroom","Fruiting_body","Mycelium","Cell_(biology)","Primordia","Thatch","Dew","Hyphae","Critically_endangered","Mycelium","Malheur_National_Forest","United_States","Mycelial_cord","Garnish_(food)","B_vitamin","Riboflavin","Niacin","Pantothenic_acid","Essential_mineral","Selenium","Copper","Potassium","Carbohydrate","Calorie","Vitamin_C","Sodium","Ultraviolet","Ergosterol","Vitamin_D","Functional_food","Cooking","Cuisine","Chinese_cuisine","Korean_cuisine","European_cuisine","Japanese_food","Indian_food","Hindi","Supermarkets","Mushroom_farm","Shiitake","Maitake","Hen-of-the-woods","Oyster_mushroom","Enoki","Poisonous_mushroom","Carcinogen","Hydrazine","Agaritine","Allergy","Asthma","Anaphylaxis","Mushroom_hunting","People's_Republic_of_China","Secondary_metabolites","Bioluminescence","List_of_deadly_fungi","Emetic","Heavy_metal_(chemistry)","Chernobyl_disaster","Psilocybin","Psychedelic_drug","Smart_shop","Underground_economy","Religious_experience","Obsessive-compulsive_disorder","Cluster_headache","Migraine_headache","Anxiety","Muscimol","Muscimol","Amatoxins","Phallotoxin","Hepatoxic","Extracts","Disease","Polysaccharide","Glycoproteins","Proteoglycan","Immune_system","Tumor","Traditional_Chinese_medicine","Polysaccharide-K","Lentinan","Animal_model","Pilot_studies","Innate_immune_system","Adaptive_immune_system","Biological_response_modifiers","Schizophyllan","Polysaccharide_Peptide","Adjuvant_cancer_therapies","Dyeing","Wool","Chromophore","Mushroom_dyes","Dye","Polypore","Tinder_fungus","Mycorrhiza","Mycoremediation","Mycofiltration","IUCN_Red_List_of_Threatened_Species","Simon's_Rock_College"]}
