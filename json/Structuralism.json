It works to\nuncover the structures that underlie all the things that humans do, think,\nperceive, and feel. Alternately, as summarized by philosopher Simon\nBlackburn, Structuralism is \"the belief that phenomena of human life are not\nintelligible except through their interrelations. These relations constitute\na structure, and behind local variations in the surface phenomena there are\nconstant laws of abstract culture\". Blackburn, Simon\n(2008).

Moscow and Copenhagen schools of linguistics.\nIn the late 1950s and early '60s, when structural linguistics was facing serious\nchallenges from the likes of Noam Chomsky and thus fading in importance, an\narray of scholars in the humanities borrowed Saussure's concepts for use in\ntheir respective fields of study. French anthropologist Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss was\narguably the first such scholar, sparking a widespread interest in\nStructuralism.\n\nThe structuralist mode of reasoning has been applied in a diverse range of\nfields, including anthropology, sociology, psychology, literary criticism,\neconomics and architecture. The most prominent thinkers associated with\nstructuralism include LÃ©vi-Strauss, linguist Roman Jakobson, and psychoanalyst\nJacques Lacan. As an intellectual movement, structuralism was initially presumed\nto be the heir apparent to existentialism. However, by the late 1960s, many of\nstructuralism's basic tenets came under attack from a new wave of predominantly\nFrench intellectuals such as the philosopher and historian Michel Foucault, the\nphilosopher and social commentator Jacques Derrida, the Marxist philosopher\nLouis Althusser, and the literary critic Roland Barthes.\nThough elements of their work necessarily relate to structuralism and are\ninformed by it, these theorists have generally been referred to as post-\nstructuralists.\n\nIn the 1970s, structuralism was criticised for its rigidity and ahistoricism.\nDespite this, many of structuralism's proponents, such as Jacques Lacan,\ncontinue to assert an influence on continental philosophy and many of the\nfundamental assumptions of some of structuralism's post-structuralist critics\nare a continuation of structuralism.
