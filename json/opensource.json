Proceedings of the\nSAICSIT 2010 Conference - Fountains of Computing Research, edited by Paula\nKotze, Aurona Gerber, Alta van der Merwe, and Nicola Bidwell. ACM Press, p. 75\n- 85,978-1-60558-950-3 Before the phrase open source became widely\nadopted, developers and producers used a variety of terms for the concept; open\nsource gained hold with the rise of the Internet, and the attendant need for\nmassive retooling of the computing source code. Opening the source\ncode enabled a self-enhancing diversity of production models, communication\npaths, and interactive communities. The complexity of such communication\nrelates to Brooks' law, and it is also described by Eric S. Raymond, \"Brooks\npredicts that as your number of programmers N rises, work performed scales as N\nbut complexity and vulnerability to bugs rises as N-squared. N-squared tracks\nthe number of communications paths (and potential code interfaces) between\ndevelopers' code bases.\"[http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-revenge.html \"The\nRevenge of the Hackers\"]. 2000. The open-source software movement arose\nto clarify the environment that the new copyright, licensing, domain, and\nconsumer issues created.\n\nGenerally, open source refers to a program in which the source code is available\nto the general public for use and/or modification from its original design. Open\nsource code is typically created as a collaborative effort in which programmers\nimprove upon the code and share the changes within the community. Open source\nsprouted in the technological community as a response to proprietary software\nowned by corporations.\n\nThe open-source model includes the concept of concurrent yet different agendas\nand differing approaches in production, in contrast with more centralized models\nof development such as those typically used in commercial software\ncompanies. Raymond, Eric S.  A main principle and practice of open-\nsource software development is peer production by bartering and collaboration,\nwith the end-product, source-material, \"blueprints\", and documentation available\nat no cost to the public. This model is also used for the development of open-source-\nappropriate technologies, [http://www.academia.edu/1517361/The_Case_for_Ope-\nn_Source_Appropriate_Technology \"The Case for Open Source Appropriate\nTechnologyâ, Environment, Development and Sustainability 14, pp. 425â431\n(2012).] DOI:10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 solar photovoltaic technology\n and open-source drug discovery.
