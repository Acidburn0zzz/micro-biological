The activity began in the late 1970s in Sweden (where it is known as\n'Kaninhoppning'). It was popularized in the United Kingdom following an\nappearance on the TV show [[That's Life!]]. There are more than fifty rabbit\nshow jumping clubs throughout Scandinavia.\n\nSome people compare rabbit show jumping to equestrian show jumping. Trainers and\ndevotees can win titles and awards during events sponsored by groups such as the\nAmerican Hopping Association for Rabbits and Cavies (Guinea Pigs), U.S. Rabbit\nAgility Association, Rabbithopping-USA, the American Association of Sporting\nEvents for Rabbits, 4-H Club fairs, and other venues. Denmark, Sweden, Finland,\nNorway and the United Kingdom hold local and nationally sanctioned events.\n\nThe event depends on the type of rabbit, with separate competitions for small\nrabbits and larger rabbits. The rules are quite different in all countries\nexcept Sweden and Norway, therefore it's hard to organize an international\ncompetition. Rabbit jumping is also an activity in America, that is gaining\npopularity. The official world record in high jump for rabbits is 1 meter\n(39.37 in), by SnÃ¶flingans Majesty of Night & Tarkan SÃ¶nmez (Sweden). The\nofficial world record in long jump for rabbits is 3 meters (118.11 in), by\nYaboo & Maria Jensen (Denmark).\n\nAt the 2010 Polynesian Rabbit Olympics, the first flight by a rabbit was\nrecorded. Polynesian Rabbit Oplympics * 'Stripey Joe Marlowe'\nsuccessfully jumped aboard a custom built microlight and landed the aircraft\nafter a five minute flight. Previous attempts at this stunt have ended in\ndisaster; at the 2006 event two rabbits, McCoy Chipper and Twitchie, died after\nfalling 12m and 17m respectively. Since Stripey Joe Marlowe's success, more\npeople are taking the sport of rabbit-flying seriously.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"rabbit_show_jumping","recorded":1376428035,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animals in sport","Pet rabbits"],"headings":["Breeds","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Domestic_rabbit","Sweden","United_Kingdom","Scandinavia","Equestrianism","Show_jumping","American_Association_of_Sporting_Events_for_Rabbits","4-H_Club","Denmark","Sweden","Finland","Norway","United_Kingdom","High_jump","Rabbit","Polish_rabbit","Netherland_dwarf","Flemish_Giant","French_Lop","Angora_rabbit","English_Lop","Belgian_Hare","Rat_agility","Dog_agility","Cat_agility","Behavioral_enrichment"]}
