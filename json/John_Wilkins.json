He was a polymath,\nalthough not one of the most important scientific innovators of the period. His\npersonal qualities were brought out, and obvious to his contemporaries, in\nreducing political tension in Interregnum Oxford, in founding the Royal Society\non non-partisan lines, and in efforts to reach out to religious nonconformists.\nHe was one of the founders of the new natural theology compatible with the\nscience of the time. Alister E. McGrath, A Scientific Theology: Nature\n(2001), p. 242.\n\nHe is particularly known for [[An Essay towards a Real Character and a\nPhilosophical Language]] (1668) in which, amongst other things, he proposed a\nuniversal language and a decimal system of measure not unlike the modern\nmetric system.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"John_Wilkins","recorded":1376428703,"links":[],"instances":["minister","astronomer","writer","religion","theologian","bishop_of_worcester","general","bishop_of_salisbury","ecclesiastical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1614 births","1672 deaths","Bishops of Chester","English scientists","Pre-19th-century cryptographers","Founder Fellows of the Royal Society","Wardens of Wadham College, Oxford","Masters of Trinity College, Cambridge","Alumni of Magdalen Hall, Oxford","Language creators","English Anglicans","People from Daventry (district)","Natural philosophers","Deans of Ripon","People from Northamptonshire"],"headings":["Early life","In Oxford and Cambridge","In London","Bishop","Death and legacy","Works","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["john_bainbridge","astronomer"],["seth_ward","bishop"],["matthew_wren","1629-1672"],["rector","ecclesiastical"],["seth_ward","bishop_of_salisbury"],["classis","religion"],["william_bates","1625-1699"],["john_owen","theologian"],["john_webster","minister"],["john_lambert","general"],["alexander_ross","writer"],["william_lloyd","bishop_of_worcester"]],"members":["john_webster","john_bainbridge","alexander_ross","classis","matthew_wren","john_owen","william_bates","william_lloyd","john_lambert","seth_ward","rector"],"related":["Fawsley,_Northamptonshire","London","Wadham_College,_Oxford","Trinity_College,_Cambridge","Royal_Society","Bishop_of_Chester","Church_of_England","Robina_Cromwell","Oliver_Cromwell","Royal_Society","Anglican_ministry","Natural_philosophy","Invisible_College","Royal_Society","Bishop_of_Chester","University_of_Oxford","University_of_Cambridge","Polymath","English_Interregnum","Nonconformist","Natural_theology","Alister_E._McGrath","Universal_language","Canons_Ashby","Northamptonshire","Goldsmith","Walter_Pope","John_Dod","Hertford_College,_Oxford","Oxford","John_Tombes","John_Bainbridge_(astronomer)","Vicar","Fawsley","William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele","George_Berkeley,_8th_Baron_Berkeley","Karl_I_Ludwig,_Elector_Palatine","Charles_I_of_England","Elector_of_the_Palatinate","Rhine","Peace_of_Westphalia","Heidelberg","Charles_Scarburgh","George_Ent","Samuel_Foster","Francis_Glisson","Jonathan_Goddard","Christopher_Merrett","John_Wallis","William_Harvey","Seth_Ward_(bishop)","Theodore_Haak","Wadham_College,_Oxford","Christopher_Wren","Oliver_Cromwell","Cavalier","Oxford_Philosophical_Club","Thomas_Sprat","Ralph_Bathurst","Robert_Boyle","William_Petty","Lawrence_Rooke","Thomas_Willis","Matthew_Wren_(1629-1672)","Robert_Hooke","Christ_Church,_Oxford","Richard_Busby","Christ_Church,_Oxford","Whitehall_Palace","Trinity_College,_Cambridge","Richard_Cromwell","Lord_Protector","Isaac_Barrow","English_Restoration","Prebendary","Rector_(ecclesiastical)","Cranford,_London","Middlesex","Gray's_Inn","Seth_Ward_(bishop_of_Salisbury)","St_Lawrence_Jewry","London","Great_Fire_of_London","Royal_Society","Henry_Oldenburg","Polebrook","Prebendary","Exeter_Cathedral","St_Paul's_Cathedral","Bishop","Chester,_England","George_Villiers,_2nd_Duke_of_Buckingham","Religious_tolerance","Presbyterians","Church_of_England","John_Humfrey","William_Piers","Classis_(religion)","William_Bates_(1625-1699)","Richard_Baxter","Thomas_Manton","Hezekiah_Burton","John_Owen_(theologian)","Kidney_stone","Historical_fiction","Neal_Stephenson","Jorge_Luis_Borges","Cryptography","Natural_philosopher","Francis_Godwin","Cryptography","Lever","Guidobaldo_del_Monte","Marin_Mersenne","Trithemius","John_Dee","Rosicrucians","Robert_Fludd","Ciceronian","Elocution","Divine_providence","John_Webster_(minister)","John_Lambert_(general)","Barebone's_Parliament","Aristotle","Galen","Alexander_Ross_(writer)","Decimal","Metric_system","William_Lloyd_(bishop_of_Worcester)","Fawsley,_Northamptonshire","England","London","England"]}
