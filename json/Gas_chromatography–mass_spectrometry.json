{"cursor":"28379","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Gas chromatographyâmass spectrometry' ('GC-MS') is a method that combines the\nfeatures of gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify\ndifferent substances within a test sample. Applications of GC-MS include drug\ndetection, fire investigation, environmental analysis, explosives investigation,\nand identification of unknown samples. GC-MS can also be used in airport\nsecurity to detect substances in luggage or on human beings. Additionally, it\ncan identify trace elements in materials that were previously thought to have\ndisintegrated beyond identification.\n\nGC-MS has been widely heralded as a \"gold standard\" for forensic substance\nidentification because it is used to perform a specific test. A specific test\npositively identifies the actual presence of a particular substance in a given\nsample. A non-specific test merely indicates that a substance falls into a\ncategory of substances. Although a non-specific test could statistically suggest\nthe identity of the substance, this could lead to false positive identification.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Gas_chromatographyâmass_spectrometry","recorded":1376429129,"links":[],"instances":["test","chemistry","moon"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mass spectrometry","Chromatography","Laboratory techniques","Explosive detection"],"headings":["History","Instrumentation","Ionization","Analysis","Applications","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["gold_standard","test"],["volatility","chemistry"],["titan","moon"]],"members":["gold_standard","volatility","titan"],"related":["Gas-liquid_chromatography","Mass_spectrometry","Drug_abuse","Fire","Explosives","Trace_element","Gold_standard_(test)","Forensics","False_positive","Miniaturized","Computer","Quadrupole_mass_analyzer","Gas_chromatograph","Mass_spectrometer","Molecule","Ion","Flame_ionization_detector","Volatility_(chemistry)","Purge_and_trap","Nitrogen","Pressure_gradient","Adsorbent","Volatile_organic_compounds","BTEX","Hewlett-Packard","Agilent","Electron_ionization","Electron_ionization","Chemical_ionization","Methane","Ammonia","Computer","Formula","Chemical_element","Isotope","Ion","Matrix_interference","Persistent_Organic_Pollutant","Environmental_monitoring","Crime","Fire","Anabolic_steroids","Explosive_detection","United_States_of_America","Airport","Federal_Aviation_Administration","Egis_explosives_detector","Food","Beverage","Aromatic_compounds","Esters","Fatty_acids","Alcohols","Aldehydes","Terpenes","Adulteration","Pesticides","Mars","Viking_program","Venera","Pioneer_Venus","Venus","Huygens_probe","Cassini-Huygens","Saturn's","Titan_(moon)","Comet","67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko","Rosetta_space_probe","Inborn_error_of_metabolism","Isotopic_labeling","Metabolism","Carbon-13","Liquid_chromatography–mass_spectrometry","Ion-mobility_spectrometry–mass_spectrometry","Prolate_trochoidal_mass_spectrometer"]}
