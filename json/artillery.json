{"cursor":"104642","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n\n'Artillery' is a weapon of war that operates by projection of munitions far\nbeyond the effective range of personal weapons. Artillery comprise specialised\ndevices which use some form of stored energy to operate, whether mechanical,\nchemical, or electromagnetic. Originally designed to breach fortifications, they\nhave evolved from nearly static installations intended to reduce a single\nobstacle to highly mobile weapons of great flexibility in which now reposes the\ngreater portion of a modern army's offensive capabilities.\n\nOriginally artillery was any group of infantry primarily armed with projectile\nweapons. Since the development of cannon, the word \"artillery\" in practice has\nlargely meant cannon; in contemporary usage it usually refers to shell-firing\nguns, howitzers, mortars, and rockets. In common speech the word artillery is\nindividual devices, together with their accessories and fittings, although these\nassemblages are more properly called equipment. By association, artillery may\nalso refer to the arm of service that customarily operates such engines.\n\nArtillery is the most lethal form of land-based armament; in the Napoleonic\nWars, World War I and World War II the vast majority of combat deaths were\ncaused by artillery. Christopher Bellamy, Oxford Companion to\nMilitary History: artillery In 1944, Joseph Stalin said in a speech that\nartillery was \"the God of War\".\n","linknr":-1,"url":"artillery","recorded":1376418440,"links":[],"instances":["person","siege_weapon","1905","fire_control_software_suite","projectile","photographer","military_unit","weapon","warfare","weaponry","munitions","company","weapon","explosives","artillery"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Artillery|","Explosive
