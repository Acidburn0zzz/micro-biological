In 1851 he began studying at\nCharles University in Prague. In 1856 he graduated as doctor of philosophy, and\nthen adopted a botanical career, establishing himself as [[Privatdozent]] for\nplant physiology in the University of Prague. In 1859 he was appointed\nphysiological assistant to the Agricultural Academy of Tharandt (now part of the\nTechnical University of Dresden) at Julius Adolph StÃ¶ckhardt; and in 1862 he was\ncalled to be director of the Polytechnic at Chemnitz, but was almost immediately\ntransferred to the Agricultural Academy at Poppelsdorf (now part of the\nUniversity of Bonn), where he remained until 1867, when he was nominated\nprofessor of botany in the University of Freiburg. In 1868 he accepted the chair\nof botany in the University of WÃ¼rzburg, which he continued to occupy (in spite\nof calls to all the important German universities) until his death.\n\nSachs achieved distinction as an investigator, a writer and a teacher; his name\nwill ever be especially associated with the great development of plant\nphysiology which marked the latter half of the 19th century, though there is\nscarcely a branch of botany to which he did not materially contribute. His\nearlier papers, scattered through the volumes of botanical journals and of the\npublications of learned societies (a collected edition was published in 1892-\n93), are of great and varied interest. Prominent among them is the series of\n\"Keimungsgeschichten,\" which laid the foundation of our knowledge of\nmicrochemical methods, as also of the morphological and physiological details of\ngermination.\n\nThen there is his resuscitation of the method of \"water-culture,\" and the\napplication of it to the investigation of the problems of nutrition; and\nfurther, his discovery that the starch-grains to be found in chloroplasts are\nthe first visible product of their assimilatory activity. His later papers were\nalmost exclusively published in the three volumes of the Arbeiten des\nbotanischen Instituts in WÃ¼rzburg (1871â88). Among these are his investigation\nof the periodicity of growth in length, in connection with which he devised the\nself-registering auxanometer, by which he established the retarding influence of\nthe highly refrangible rays of the spectrum on the rate of growth; his\nresearches on heliotropism and geotropism, in which he introduced the clinostat;\nhis work on the structure and the arrangement of cells in growing-points; the\nelaborate experimental evidence upon which he based his \"imbibition-theory\" of\nthe transpiration-current; his exhaustive study of the assimilatory activity of\nthe green leaf; and other papers of interest.\n\nSachs' first published volume was the Handbuch der Experimentalphysiologie des\nPflanzen (1865; French edition, 1868), which gives an admirable account of the\nstate of knowledge in certain departments of the subject, and includes a great\ndeal of original information. This was followed in 1868 by the first edition of\nhis famous Lehrbuch der Botanik, by far the best book of its kind. It is a\ncomprehensive work, giving an able summary of the botanical science of the\nperiod, enriched with the results of many original investigations. The fourth\nand last German edition was published in 1874, and two English editions were\nissued by the Oxford Press in 1875 and 1882 respectively.\n\nThe Lehrbuch was eventually superseded by the Vorlesungen uber\nPflanzenphysiologie (1st ed., 1882; 2nd ed., 1887; Eng. ed., Oxford, 1887), a\nwork more limited in scope, but yet covering more ground than its title would\nimply; though it is a remarkable book, it has not gained the general recognition\naccorded to the Lehrbuch. Finally, there is the Geschichte der Botanik (1875); a\nbrilliant and learned account of the development of the various branches of\nbotanical science from the middle of the 16th century up to 1860, of which an\nEnglish edition was published in 1890 by the Oxford Press. As a teacher Sachs\nexerted great influence, for his vigorous personality and his ready and lucid\nutterance enabled him not only to instruct, but to fire his students with\nsomething of his own enthusiasm.\n\nA full account of Sachs' life and work was given by Professor Goebel, formerly\nhis assistant, in Flora (1897), of which an English translation appeared in\nScience Progress for 1898. There is also an obituary notice of him in the Proc.\nRoy. Soc. vol. lxii.\n\nMany pupils of Sachs like Julius Oscar Brefeld, Francis Darwin, Karl Ritter von\nGoebel, Georg Albrecht Klebs, Hermann MÃ¼ller-Thurgau, Fritz Noll, Wilhelm\nPfeffer, Karl Prantl, Christian Ernst Stahl and Hugo de Vries became later\nfamous botanists.\n\nThe standard botanical author abbreviation 'Sachs' is applied to species he\ndescribed.\n","linknr":189,"url":"Julius_von_Sachs","recorded":1376425401,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Julius_von_Sachs&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Julius_von_Sachs&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_von_Sachs","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Julius_Sachs","/wiki/File:Julius_Sachs.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Julius_Sachs.jpg/300px-Julius_Sachs.jpg","/wiki/Wroc%C5%82aw","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia","/wiki/W%C3%BCrzburg","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bavaria","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Botany","/wiki/University_of_Bonn","/wiki/University_of_Freiburg","/wiki/University_of_W%C3%BCrzburg","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/Charles_University_in_Prague","/wiki/Jan_Evangelista_Purkyn%C4%9B","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_German","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Botanist","/wiki/Wroc%C5%82aw","/wiki/Prussian_Silesia","/wiki/Natural_history","/wiki/Physiologist","/wiki/Jan_Evangelista_Purkyn%C4%9B","/wiki/Charles_University_in_Prague","/wiki/Privatdozent","/wiki/Plant_physiology","/wiki/Charles_University_in_Prague","/wiki/Technical_University_of_Dresden","/wiki/Julius_Adolph_St%C3%B6ckhardt","/wiki/Chemnitz_University_of_Technology","/wiki/University_of_Bonn","/wiki/University_of_Freiburg","/wiki/University_of_W%C3%BCrzburg","/wiki/Morphology_(biology)","/wiki/Germination","/wiki/Starch","/wiki/Chloroplasts","/wiki/Auxanometer","/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum","/wiki/Heliotropism","/wiki/Geotropism","/wiki/Clinostat","/wiki/Leaf","/wiki/Julius_Oscar_Brefeld","/wiki/Francis_Darwin","/wiki/Karl_Ritter_von_Goebel","/wiki/Georg_Albrecht_Klebs","/wiki/Hermann_M%C3%BCller_(Thurgau)","/wiki/Fritz_Noll","/wiki/Wilhelm_Pfeffer","/wiki/Karl_Anton_Eugen_Prantl","/wiki/Christian_Ernst_Stahl","/wiki/Hugo_de_Vries","/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature#Authorship_in_scientific_names","/wiki/Species","/w/index.php?title=Julius_von_Sachs&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Julius_von_Sachs&veaction=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Julius_von_Sachs&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Julius_von_Sachs&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Wikisource-logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Sachs,_Julius_von","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","/w/index.php?title=Wurzbg_Medizinhist_Mitt&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17153314","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC440044","/wiki/Plant_Physiol.","/wiki/PubMed_Central","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC440044","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16652596","/w/index.php?title=Julius_von_Sachs&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Julius_von_Sachs&veaction=edit&section=3","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/15px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Julius_von_Sachs","/wiki/Authority_control","http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n82-239838","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/76385061","/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n82239838","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Wroc%C5%82aw","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia","/wiki/W%C3%BCrzburg","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bavaria","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Julius_von_Sachs&oldid=560288207","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1832_births","/wiki/Category:1897_deaths","/wiki/Category:19th-century_German_people","/wiki/Category:19th-century_botanists","/wiki/Category:Jewish_scientists","/wiki/Category:German_botanists","/wiki/Category:Botanists_with_author_abbreviations","/wiki/Category:German_Jews","/wiki/Category:Silesian_Jews","/wiki/Category:German_untitled_nobility","/wiki/Category:People_from_Wroc%C5%82aw","/wiki/Category:People_from_the_Province_of_Silesia","/wiki/Category:Charles_University_in_Prague_alumni","/wiki/Category:Academics_of_Charles_University_in_Prag
