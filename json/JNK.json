They belong to the mitogen-activated protein kinase family,\nand are responsive to stress stimuli, such as cytokines, ultraviolet\nirradiation, heat shock, and osmotic shock. They also play a role in T cell\ndifferentiation and the cellular apoptosis pathway. Activation occurs through a\ndual phosphorylation of threonine (Thr) and tyrosine (Tyr) residues within a Thr-Pro-\nTyr motif located in kinase subdomain VIII. Activation is carried out by two MAP\nkinases, MKK4 and MKK7 and JNK can be inactivated by Ser/Thr and Tyr protein\nphosphatases. It has been suggested that this signaling\npathway contributes to inflammatory responses in mammals and insects.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"JNK","recorded":1376428343,"links":[],"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 2.7.11"],"headings":["Isoforms","Function","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["itch","biology"]],"members":["itch"],"related":["MAPK8","MAPK8","Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_9","MAPK10","MAPK10","Kinase","Phosphorylation","C-Jun","Serine","Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase","Cytokines","Ultraviolet","Osmotic","T_cell","Apoptosis","Threonine","Tyrosine","Proline","MKK4","MKK7","Phosphatase","Protein_isoform","MAPK8","Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_9","MAPK10","Exon","MAPK8","Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_9","MAPK10","Protein_phosphatase","Scaffold_protein","JNK_interacting_proteins","MAP2K4","MAP2K7","C-jun","Activating_transcription_factor_2","ELK1","Mothers_against_decapentaplegic_homolog_4","P53","HSF1","NFATC3","NFATC1","STAT3","Apoptosis","Neurodegeneration","Cytokine","AP-1_transcription_factor","RANTES","Interleukin_8","GM-CSF","C-jun","Protein_turnover","Phosphorylation","Ubiquitin_ligase","ITCH_(biology)"]}
