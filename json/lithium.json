{"cursor":"73614","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Lithium' (from Greek lithos 'stone') is a chemical element with\nsymbol 'Li' and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silver-white metal\nbelonging to the alkali metal group of chemical elements. Under standard\nconditions it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. Like all\nalkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable. For this reason, it is\ntypically stored in mineral oil. When cut open, lithium exhibits a metallic\nluster, but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull\nsilvery gray, then black tarnish. Because of its high reactivity, lithium never\noccurs freely in nature, and instead, only appears in compounds, which are\nusually ionic. Lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals, but due to its\nsolubility as an ion is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from\nbrines and clays. On a commercial scale, lithium is isolated electrolytically\nfrom a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\n\nThe nuclei of lithium verge on instability, since the two stable lithium\nisotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of\nall stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is\nless common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even\nthough the nuclei are very light in atomic weight. Numerical data from: Graphed at  For related reasons,\nlithium has important links to nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium\natoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction, and lithium-\n6 deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear\nweapons. [http://www.fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/design.htm Nuclear Weapon\nDesign]. Federation of American Scientists (1998-10-21). fas.org\n\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-\nresistant glass and ceramics, high strength-to-weight alloys used in aircraft,\nlithium batteries and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than half\nof lithium production.\n\nTrace amounts of lithium are present in all organisms. The element serves no\napparent vital biological function, since animals and plants survive in good\nhealth without it. Non-vital functions have not been ruled out. The lithium ion\nLi + administered as any of several lithium salts has proved to be\nuseful as a mood-stabilizing drug in the treatment of bipolar disorder, due to\nneurological effects of the ion in the human body.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"lithium","recorded":1376429098,"links":[],"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","metallurgy","medication","geology","chemistry","physics","electricity","periodic_table","data_page","lubricant","mass","mineralogy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lithium|","Alkali
