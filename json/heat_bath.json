The\ntemperature of the reservoir does not change irrespective of whether heat is\nadded or extracted. As it can act as a source and sink of heat it is often also\nreferred to a 'heat reservoir' or 'heat bath'.\n\nLakes, oceans and rivers often serve as thermal reservoirs in geophysical\nprocesses, such as the weather. In atmospheric science, large air masses in the\natmosphere often function as thermal reservoirs.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"heat_bath","recorded":1376429062,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Thermodynamics"],"headings":["References"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Thermodynamic_system","Heat_capacity","Thermal_contact","Thermal_energy","Temperature","Heat","Heat"]}
