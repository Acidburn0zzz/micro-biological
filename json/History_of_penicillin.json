Year Location Descriptions\n|- Ancient times Greece & India Many ancient cultures, including the ancient\n|Greeks and ancient India, already used moulds and other plants to treat\n|infection. }} This worked because some moulds produce antibiotic\n|substances. However, they could not distinguish or distill the active component\n|in the moulds. - \"traditional medicine\" Serbia & Greece There are many old\n|remedies where mould is involved. In Serbia and in Greece, mouldy bread was a\n|traditional treatment for wounds and infections. - \"traditional\" Russia Russian\n|peasants used warm soil as treatment for infected wounds. -\n| c. 150 BC Sri Lanka Soldiers in the army of king Dutugemunu (161â137 BC) are\n|    recorded to have stored oil cakes (a traditional Sri Lankan sweetmeat) for\n|    long periods in their hearth lofts before embarking on their campaigns, in\n|    order to make a poultice of the cakes to treat wounds. It is assumed that\n|    the oil cakes served the dual functions of desiccant and antibacterial. -\n|    1600s Poland Wet bread was mixed with spider webs (containing spores) to\n|    treat wounds. The technique was mentioned by Henryk Sienkiewicz in his 1884\n|    book [[With Fire and Sword]]. - 1640 England The idea of using mould as a\n|    form of treatment was recorded by apothecaries, such as John Parkington,\n|    King's Herbarian, who advocated the use of mould in his 1640 book on\n|    pharmacology. - 1870 United Kingdom Sir John Scott Burdon-Sanderson, who\n|    started out at St. Mary's Hospital 1852â1858 and as lecturer there\n|    1854â1862 observed in 1870 that culture fluid covered with mould would\n|    produce no bacteria. - 1871 United Kingdom Joseph Lister, an English\n|    surgeon and the father of modern antisepsis, was prompted by Burdon-\n|    Sanderson's discovery to investigate and describe in 1871 that urine\n|    samples contaminated with mould did not allow the growth of bacteria. He\n|    also described the antibacterial action on human tissue of what he called\n|    Penicillium glaucum. A nurse at King's College Hospital whose wounds did\n|    not respond to any antiseptic, was then given another substance that cured\n|    her, and Lister's registrar informed her that it was called Penicillium. -\n|    1874 United Kingdom William Roberts observed in 1874 that bacterial\n|    contamination is generally absent in cultures of the mould [[Penicillium\n|    glaucum]]. - 1875 United Kingdom John Tyndall followed up on Burdon-\n|    Sanderson's work and demonstrated to the Royal Society the antibacterial\n|    action of the Penicillium fungus in 1875. - 1875\n|\n| [[Bacillus anthracis]] was shown to cause anthrax. This was the first\n| demonstration that a specific bacterium caused a specific disease. - 1877\n| France Louis Pasteur and Jules Francois Joubert observed that cultures of the\n| anthrax bacilli, when contaminated with moulds, became inhibited. Some\n| references say that Pasteur identified the strain as [[Penicillium notatum]].\n| - 1887 France GarrÃ© in 1887 found similar results. - 1895 Italy Vincenzo\n| Tiberio, physician of the University of Naples published a research about a\n| mould in a water well that had an antibacterial action. }}\n| |publisher=Festival2011.festivalscienza.it |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13|postscript= }} - 1897 France Ernest Duchesne\n| at Ãcole du Service de SantÃ© Militaire in Lyons independently discovered\n| healing properties of a Penicillium glaucum mould, even curing infected guinea\n| pigs from typhoid. He published a dissertation [http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DZVXPIK Duchesne 1897], Antagonism between\n| molds and bacteria. An English translation by Michael Witty. Fort Myers, 2013.\n| ASIN B00E0KRZ0E and B00DZVXPIK. in 1897 but this was ignored by the\n| Institut Pasteur. However Duchesne was himself using a discovery made by Arab\n| stable boys, who were using moulds to cure sores on horses. He did not claim\n| that the mould contained any antibacterial substance, only that the mould\n| somehow protected the animals.\n\n* Duchesne cured typhoid, but the penicillin isolated by Fleming does not\n  cure typhoid.\n* Duchesne injected a mould with the fungus Penicillium glaucum. In contrast,\n  Fleming isolated the substance penicillin from the mould Penicillium notatum.\n* The term Penicillium glaucum was used as a catch-all phrase at the time for\n  different fungi, but not for Penicillium notatum and the mould was\n  unfortunately not preserved, which makes it impossible to be certain today\n  which fungus might have been responsible for the cure, and consequently, even\n  less certain which substance was responsible.\n|- 1920 Belgium In the 1920s, Andre Gratia and Sara Dath observed a fungal\n|contamination in one of their Staphylococcus aureus cultures that was\n|inhibiting the growth of the bacterium. They identified this as a species of\n|Penicillium and presented their observations as a paper. There was little\n|attention to this paper. - 1923 Costa Rica An Institut Pasteur scientist, Costa\n|Rican Clodomiro Picado Twight recorded the antibiotic effect of Penicillium. -\n|1928 United Kingdom Scottish biologist Sir Alexander Fleming noticed a halo of\n|inhibition of bacterial growth around a contaminant blue-green mould on a\n|[[Staphylococcus]] plate culture. He concluded that the mould was releasing a\n|substance that was inhibiting bacterial growth. He grew a pure culture of the\n|mould and discovered that it was Penicillium notatum. With help from a chemist,\n|he concentrated what he later named \"penicillin\". During the next twelve years,\n|he grew and distributed the original mould, unsuccessfully trying to get help\n|from any chemist that had enough skill to make a stable form of it, for mass\n|production. - 1930 United Kingdom Cecil George Paine, a pathologist at the\n|Royal Infirmary in Sheffield, attempted to treat sycosis (eruptions in beard\n|follicles) with penicillin but was unsuccessful, probably because the drug did\n|not penetrate deep enough. Moving on to opthalmia neonatorum, a gonococcal\n|infection in babies, he achieved the first cure on 25 November 1930. He cured\n|four patients (one adult, the others babies) of eye infections, although a\n|fifth patient was not so lucky. - 1938 United Kingdom In Oxford,\n|Howard Walter Florey organized his large and very skilled biochemical research\n|team, notable among them Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley, to undertake\n|innovative work to produce a stable penicillin. - 1941â1943 USA Peoria,\n|Illinois: Moyer, Coghill and Raper at the USDA [[National Center for\n|Agricultural Utilization Research|Northern Regional Research Laboratory\n]] (NRRL) developed methods for industrialized penicillin production and\nisolated higher-yielding strains of the Penicillium\nfungus.\n|- 1941â1944 USA\n|Brooklyn, New York: Jasper Kane and other Pfizer scientists developed the\npractical, deep-tank fermentation method for production of large quantities of\npharmaceutical-grade penicillin.\n|- 1945 United Kingdom Oxford: Using X-ray crystallographic analysis, Dorothy\n|Hodgkin elucidated the correct chemical structure of penicillin. - 1952 Austria\n|Kundl, Tyrol: Hans Margreiter and Ernst Brandl of Biochemie (now Sandoz)\ndeveloped the first acid-stable penicillin for oral administration, Penicillin\nV.\n|- 1957 USA\n|Chemist John C. Sheehan at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)\ncompleted the first chemical synthesis of penicillin in 1957.\n|}\n","linknr":203,"url":"History_of_penicillin","recorded":1376419655,"links":["/w/index.php?title=History_of_penicillin&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=History_of_penicillin&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_penicillin","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Penicillin-G_3D.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Penicillin-G_3D.png/220px-Penicillin-G_3D.png","/wiki/File:Penicillin-G_3D.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Alexander_Fleming","/wiki/Penicillium","/wiki/Penicillin","/wiki/Ernst_Chain","/wiki/Howard_Florey","/wiki/Norman_Heatley","/wiki/Ancient_Greece","/wiki/History_of_India","/wiki/Mould","/wiki/Infections","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Dutugemunu","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Spores","/wiki/Henryk_Sienkiewicz","/wiki/With_Fire_and_Sword","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/John_Scott_Burdon-Sanderson","/wiki/Joseph_Lister,_1st_Baron_Lister","/wiki/Antisepsis","/wiki/King%27s_College_Hospital","/wiki/William_Roberts_(physician)","/wiki/Penicillium_glaucum","/wiki/John_Tyndall","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Bacillus_anthracis","/wiki/Louis_Pasteur","/w/index.php?title=Jules_Francois_Joubert&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Penicillium_notatum","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Vincenzo_Tiberio&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/University_of_Naples","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Ernest_Duchesne","/wiki/Typhoid","#cite_note-Duchesne_1897-5","/wiki/Institut_Pasteur","/wiki/Typhoid","/wiki/Pasteur_Institute","/wiki/Costa_Rica","/wiki/Clodomiro_Picado_Twight","/wiki/Alexander_Fleming","/wiki/Staphylococcus","/wiki/Sheffield","/wiki/Sycosis","/wiki/Opthalmia_neonatorum","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Howard_Walter_Florey","/wiki/Ernst_Boris_Chain","/wiki/Norman_Heatley","/wiki/Peoria,_Illinois","/wiki/USDA","/wiki/National_Center_for_Agricultural_Utilization_Research","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Brooklyn,_New_York","/wiki/Pfizer","/wiki/Industrial_fermentation","#cite_note-9","/wiki/University_of_Oxford","/wiki/Dorothy_Hodgkin","#cite_note-JPS-10","/wiki/Kundl","/wiki/Tyrol_(state)","/wiki/Sandoz","/wiki/Phenoxymethylpenicillin","#cite_note-11","/wiki/John_C._Sheehan","/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","/wiki/Total_synthesis","#cite_note-NAPSheehan-12","/w/index.php?title=History_of_penicillin&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=History_of_penicillin&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.experiment-resources.com/history-of-antibiotics.html","#cite_ref-2","http://www1.umn.edu/ships/updates/fleming.htm","#cite_ref-3","http://www.almanacco.rm.cnr.it/reader/cw_usr_view_recensione?id_articolo=1704&giornale=1679","#cite_ref-4","http://festival2011.festivalscienza.it/site/home/programma-2011/eventi-per-tipo/conferenze/vincenzo-tiberio-vero-scopritore-degli-antibiotici.html","#cite_ref-Duchesne_1897_5-0","http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DZVXPIK","#cite_ref-6","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139580","/wiki/PubMed_Central","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139580","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3511336","#cite_ref-7","http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/nov2003.html","#cite_ref-8","http://www.historicpeoria.com/entry.php?eid=144&catid=1&cid=1","#cite_ref-9","http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/1900_1950.jsp","#cite_ref-JPS_10-0","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fpsc.888","/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#accessdate_missing_url","#cite_ref-11","http://www.medical-tribune.at/dynasite.cfm?dsmid=68732&dspaid=531457","#cite_ref-NAPSheehan_12-0","/wiki/Elias_James_Corey","http://www.nap.edu/readingroom.php?book=biomems&page=jsheehan.html","/w/index.php?title=History_of_penicillin&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=History_of_penicillin&veaction=edit&section=2","http://web.archive.org/web/20020514111940/http://www.molbio.princeton.edu/courses/mb427/2001/projects/02/antibiotics.htm","http://www.molbio.princeton.edu/courses/
