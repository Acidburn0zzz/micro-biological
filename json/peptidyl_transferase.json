{"cursor":"2865","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Peptidyl transferase' is an aminoacyltransferase () as well as the primary\nenzymatic function of the ribosome, which forms peptide bonds between adjacent\namino acids using tRNAs during the translation process of protein biosynthesis.\n\nPeptidyl transferase activity is carried out by the ribosome. Peptidyl\ntransferase activity is not mediated by any ribosomal proteins but by ribosomal\nRNA (rRNA), a ribozyme. This RNA relic is the most significant piece of evidence\nsupporting the RNA World hypothesis.\n*  In Bacteria, the 50S (23S component) ribosome subunit contains the peptidyl\n   transferase component and acts as a ribozyme.\n* In eukaryotic cells, the 60S (28S component) ribosome subunit contains the\n  peptidyl transferase component and acts as the ribozyme.\n\nPeptidyl transferases are not limited to translation, but there are relatively\nfew enzymes with this function.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"peptidyl_transferase","recorded":1376418385,"links":[],"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Transferases"],"headings":["Antibiotic target","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["translation","genetics"],["translation","genetics"]],"members":["translation"],"related":["Aminoacyltransferases","Enzyme","Ribosome","Peptide_bond","Amino_acid","TRNA","Translation_(genetics)","Protein_biosynthesis","RNA_World","Bacteria","23S_ribosomal_RNA","Eukaryote","28S_ribosomal_RNA","Protein_synthesis_inhibitor","Chloramphenicol","23S","Peptide_bond","Pleuromutilin","Macrolide","Ribosomal_translocation","Transferase","Translation_(genetics)","Enzyme"]}
