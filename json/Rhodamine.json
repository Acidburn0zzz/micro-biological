They are often used as a tracer dye\nwithin water to determine the rate and direction of flow and transport.\nRhodamine dyes fluoresce and can thus be detected easily and inexpensively with\ninstruments called fluorometers. Rhodamine dyes are used extensively in\nbiotechnology applications such as fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry,\nfluorescence correlation spectroscopy and ELISA.\n\nRhodamine dyes are generally toxic, and are soluble in water, methanol\nand ethanol.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Rhodamine","recorded":1376428368,"links":[],"instances":["fluor"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rhodamine dyes|*","Staining dyes","Fluorescent dyes","Laser gain media"],"headings":["Rhodamine B","Rhodamine 6G","Rhodamine 123","Other rhodamine derivatives","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["alexa","fluor"]],"members":["alexa"],"related":["Fluorone","Dye","Dye_laser","Gain_medium","F._J._Duarte","Tracer_dye","Fluorescence","Fluorometer","Fluorescence_microscope","Flow_cytometry","Fluorescence_correlation_spectroscopy","ELISA","Toxic","Methanol","Ethanol","Mitochondrion","Inner_respiration","P-glycoprotein","Sulforhodamine_101","Texas_Red","Isothiocyanate","Hydrogen","Amine","Succinimidyl-ester","Alexa_(fluor)","DyLight_Fluor","Photobleaching"]}
