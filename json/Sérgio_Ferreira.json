April 10, 1934, Franca, SÃ£o Paulo), Brazil,\nBrazilian physician and pharmacologist, noted for his discovery of Bradykinin\npotentiating factor, which led to better anti-hypertension drugs.\n\nFerreira received his M.D. from the Faculty of Medicine of RibeirÃ£o Preto of the\nUniversity of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) and soon became staff member of the same school,\nwhere he is presently a member of the Department of Pharmacology. His research\ntraining in pharmacology initiated in this Department with Prof. MaurÃ­cio Rocha\ne Silva, the discoverer of bradykinin. While working on this subject, he\ndiscovered a family of peptides present in the venom of a Brazilian snake,\n[[Bothrops jararaca]], which inhibited kininase activity and strongly\npotentiated the effects of bradykinin in vivo and in vitro. This factor was\nnamed bradykinin potentiating factor, BPF. In 1968, with the collaboration of\nDr. Lewis Joel Greene, from the Brookhaven National Laboratory, U.S., he\nisolated several pharmacologically active peptides responsible for the activity\nof BPF. Using those peptides, was demonstrated a general parallelism between\nbradykinin potentiation and inhibition of Angiotensin I conversion.\nSubsequently, his group elucidated the structure of the smallest peptide, and\nusing the synthetic pentapeptide, demonstrated its ability to potentiate\nbradykinin and to inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I in vivo in\nexperimental models of hypertension. His work in this area paved the way for the\ndevelopment of a new class of antihypertensive drugs, the converting enzymes\ninhibitors (ACE), by Squibb scientists. For this work with the Bothrops peptide\nhe received the CIBA Award for Hypertension Research of 1983, together with Drs.\nE. Ondetti and D. Cushman from Squibb laboratories.\n\nWhile working in London in the early seventies with John R. Vane (Nobel prize in\nMedicine, 1983), he participated in the discovery of the inhibition of the\nsynthesis of prostaglandins by aspirin-like drugs. At that time, he proposed\nthat the mechanism of the analgesic action of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory\ndrugs (NSAID) was due to the prevention of pain receptor sensitization which\nresults from an inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins. This hypothesis\nwas supported by further work from his laboratory and from many other\ninvestigators. His studies on the basic mechanisms involved in the development\nof inflammatory hyperalgesia led to the discovery that a select class of\nanalgesics like metamizole, in contrast to the classical non-steroidal\nantiinflammatory drugs, are able to counteract the ongoing sensitization of the\nprimary sensory neuron via the stimulation of the arginine/nitric oxide pathway.\nHe recently characterized a phenomenon described as retrograde sensitization of\nthe primary sensory neuron, which emphasizes the importance of the peripheral\ncomponent of the inflammatory pain. His group made a relevant contribution to\nthe role of bradykinin and of cytokines in the development of inflammatory\nhyperalgesia. He found that among the cytokines, interleukin 1 b mediates the\nendogenous release of prostaglandins and IL-8 is responsible for the development\nof the sympathetic hyperalgesia. In this area he described an antagonist of IL-1\nthat is now being developed as a model a new class of analgesics.\n\nHis contributions to science have been extensively recognized. Dr. Ferreira\nholds since 1995 the National Order of Scientific Merit in the Great Cross\nlevel, and received several awards and medals, such as from the Third World\nAcademy of Sciences (1990 and 1992), the Mexican Prize of Science and\nTechnology (199), the Rheimboldt-Hauptmann Prize of the University of SÃ£o Paulo\n(2001) and the PÃ©ter MurÃ¡nyi Prize (2002). He is in the editorial board of\nseveral international journals, is foreign member to the U.S. National Academy\nof Sciences.\n\nDr. Ferreira is also a noted scientific leader in Brazil. He helped to found and\nis one of the editors-in-chief of the most influential international biomedical\nscientific journal, Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research, is a\nmember of the Brazilian National Academy of Sciences and of the Brazilian\nCouncil of Science and Technology. He is founder and past president of the\nBrazilian Society for Pharmacology and Therapeutics and of the Brazilian Society\nfor the Progress of Science (SBPC).\n","linknr":146,"url":"SÃ©rgio_Ferreira","recorded":1376425496,"links":["/w/index.php?title=S%C3%A9rgio_Henrique_Ferreira&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=S%C3%A9rgio_Henrique_Ferreira&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9rgio_Henrique_Ferreira","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=S%C3%A9rgio_Ferreira&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Franca","/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_(state)","/wiki/Brazil","/wiki/Physician","/wiki/Pharmacologist","/w/index.php?title=Bradykinin_potentiating_factor&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Hypertension","/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine","/wiki/Faculdade_de_Medicina_de_Ribeir%C3%A3o_Preto","/wiki/Pharmacology","/wiki/Maur%C3%ADcio_Rocha_e_Silva","/wiki/Bradykinin","/wiki/Peptide","/wiki/Bothrops_jararaca","/w/index.php?title=Kininase&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Lewis_Joel_Greene","/wiki/Brookhaven_National_Laboratory","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Angiotensin","/wiki/Squibb","/wiki/Bothrops","/wiki/Novartis","/wiki/London","/wiki/John_R._Vane","/wiki/Nobel_prize","/wiki/Prostaglandins","/wiki/Aspirin","/w/index.php?title=Analgesy&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs","/wiki/Pain_receptor","/wiki/Sensitization","/wiki/Hyperalgesia","/wiki/Metamizole","/w/index.php?title=Primary_sensory_neuron&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Arginine","/wiki/Nitric_oxide","/wiki/Cytokine","/wiki/Interleukin","/wiki/Third_World_Academy_of_Sciences","/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","/wiki/Brazilian_Journal_of_Medical_and_Biological_Research","/wiki/Brazilian_National_Academy_of_Sciences","/wiki/Brazilian_Council_of_Science_and_Technology","/w/index.php?title=Brazilian_Society_for_Pharmacology_and_Therapeutics&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Brazilian_Society_for_the_Progress_of_Science","/w/index.php?title=S%C3%A9rgio_Henrique_Ferreira&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=S%C3%A9rgio_Henrique_Ferreira&veaction=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=S%C3%A9rgio_Henrique_Ferreira&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=S%C3%A9rgio_Henrique_Ferreira&veaction=edit&section=2","http://www.abc.org.br/english/orgn/acaen.asp?codigo=sferreira","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/34519240","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sérgio_Henrique_Ferreira&oldid=552439616","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Brazilian_pharmacologists","/wiki/Category:Brazilian_physicians","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Brazilian_Academy_of_Sciences","/wiki/Category:1934_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Recipients_of_the_Great_Cross_of_the_National_Order_of_Scientific_Merit_(Brazil)","/wiki/Category:University_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_alumni","/wiki/Category:People_from_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_(state)","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_February_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=S%C3%A9rgio+Henrique+Ferreira&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=S%C3%A9rgio+Henrique+Ferreira","/wiki/S%C3%A9rgio_Henrique_Ferreira","/wiki/Talk:S%C3%A9rgio_Henrique_Ferreira","#","/wiki/S%C3%A9rgio_Henrique_Ferreira","/w/index.php?title=S%C3%A9rgio_Henrique_Ferreira&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=S%C3%A9rgio_Henrique_Ferreira&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=S%C3%A9rgio_Henrique_Ferreira&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/s
