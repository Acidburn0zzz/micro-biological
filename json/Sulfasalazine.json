It was believed at the time that\nbacterial infections were the cause of rheumatoid arthritis. Sulfasalazine is a\nsulfa drug, (a derivative of mesalazine) and is formed by combining\nsulfapyridine and salicylate with an azo bond. It may be abbreviated 'SSZ'.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Sulfasalazine","recorded":1376428547,"links":[],"instances":["mood"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sulfonamides","Antirheumatic products","Drugs acting on the gastrointestinal system and metabolism","Pyridines","Azo compounds","Salicylic acids"],"headings":["Indications","Mode of action","Side effects","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["depression","mood"]],"members":["depression"],"related":["United_States","Europe","Hong_Kong","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Sulfa_drug","Mesalazine","Sulfapyridine","Salicylic_acid","Ulcerative_colitis","Crohn's_disease","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Psoriatic_arthritis","DMARDS","University_of_Newcastle_upon_Tyne","Cirrhosis_of_the_liver","Sulfapyridine","Agranulocytosis","Hypospermia","5-aminosalicylic_acid","Mesalazine","Urticaria","Eicosanoids","Cytokines","Glucocorticoids","Inflammatory_bowel_disease","Immunosuppressant","Depression_(mood)","Infertility","Thrombocytopenia","Dihydrofolate_reductase","Folate_deficiency","Megaloblastic_anemia","Hemolytic_anemia","G6PD_deficiency"]}
