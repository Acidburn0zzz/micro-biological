She\ngoes formally as Judith G. Hall and informally as Judy Hall.\n\nThe daughter of a minister, she was born in Boston, Mass. and spent her\nchildhood in New England, the midwestern U.S. and Seattle. She graduated from\nhigh school in Seattle and then attended Wellesley College in Wellesley, Mass.\nfrom which she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in 1961.\n\nShe went to medical school in Seattle at the University of Washington (UW) from\nwhich she received an MD degree in 1966. The same year she was also awarded an\nMS degree in Genetics from UW for coursework and research done with Dr. Arno\nMotulsky in medical genetics.\n\nDr. Hall then went to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore where she did\npostdoctoral fellowships in Medical Genetics with Dr. Victor McKusick and in\nPediatric Endocrinology with Dr. Robert Blizzard. She then trained in pediatrics\nat Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1969 to 1971.\n\nIn 1972 she returned to the University of Washington School of Medicine and was\ngiven a joint appointment in the Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine as,\nsuccessively, Assistant, Associate and Full Professor. She also gained\nadditional depth of knowledge concerning congenital malformations by working in\nSeattle with the pioneer dysmorphologist, Dr. David W. Smith (1926-1981).\n\nIn 1981, Hall was named Professor of Medical Genetics at the University of\nBritish Columbia and the Director of the Genetics Services for British Columbia.\nFrom 1990-2000, she was also Professor and Head of the Department of Pediatrics\nat the University of British Columbia and BC Children's Hospital.\n\nIn 1988 she received a Killam Senior Fellowship for a sabbatical year at Oxford\nUniversity, UK. During 2001, she was a Distinguished Fellow at Christ'S College,\nCambridge University, UK.\n\nDr. Hall's research has been far-ranging in the areas of congenital\nmalformations including neural tube defects, the genetics of short stature, the\nmechanisms of disease such as mosaicism and imprinting, the natural history of\ngenetic disorders, the genetics of connective tissue disorders such as\narthrogryposis, and monozygotic (identical)\ntwins. http://www.cmaj.ca/site/pdfs/hall.pdf She has contributed to\nthe knowledge of a number of syndromes. Her name is associated with the Hall\ntype of pseudoachondroplasia (a severe form of dwarfism with short limbs) and\nthe Hall-Pallister syndrome (hamartoma in the hypothalamus tract,\nhypopituitarism, imperforate anus and\npolydactyly). http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/533.html\n\nDr. Hall has received a number of honors and in 1998 was made an Officer of the\nOrder of Canada as \"a leader and world authority in both genetics and\npediatrics\" and having \"contributed to the development of resources and services\nessential to coping with genetic illnesses\"
