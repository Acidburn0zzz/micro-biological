{"cursor":"6476","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nDefinition An adoption detective is an individual who researches biological and\ngenetic connections between\nindividuals. http://www.adoptiondetectivejudithland.com/faqs They\nconduct searches of public and private records, research historical documents,\nand interview persons of interest for the purpose of uncovering genealogical\ninformation linking biologically related individuals, persons related by\nmarriage, foster parents, or other key contacts. Informally, a detective is any\nlicensed or unlicensed person who solves crimes, including historical crimes,\nor looks into records. Also known as private investigators, https://www.pi-\nmagazine.com/private_investigator_license_requirements.html police\ndetectives must pass written tests after completion of the requirements for\nbeing a police officer.\n\nInvestigations Investigations conducted by adoption detectives have potential to\nresult in lengthy arduous or convoluted worldwide investigations across\ninternational borders and geographic regions. They may create unexpected\nadventures reminiscent of classic mystery novels leading to the discovery of\npreviously hidden information, sometimes leading in directions not originally\nanticipated, or what the genealogist, detective, mystery writer, or client\noriginally had in mind. Exposure of information intentionally concealed may lead\nto unintended consequences or produce negative emotional outcomes. Adoption\ndetectives need to retain a perspicacious mind to master the elegant art of\ndetection, and remain ever vigilant to the potential for psychological trauma\nthat may be caused by exposing unwilling individuals. This type of information\nis often difficult to obtain, especially in cases where birth certificates and\nbaptismal certificates were intentionally falsified; legal documents are filed\nas concealed records not readily available to the public without a search\nwarrant; or when persons of interest are deceased, uncooperative, or desire not\nto be found.\n\nClients The majority of clients are children who were orphaned, fostered, or\nadopted seeking to reunite with biological relatives. Others include parents\nseparated from their biological children looking for reconciliation; doctors\nbenefiting from family medical histories; attorneys dealing with inheritance or\nother legal matters; police detectives researching crimes, requesting DNA, or\nother confidential personal information; historians, genealogists, and social\nresearchers; and other individuals requesting information about ancestral\nantecedents. Children who suffer from genealogical bewilderment http://judithland.wordpress.com/2012/08/28/genealogical-\nbewilderment/ have an inherent desire to learn something about their\nbiological antecedents. They possess a desire to trace their family lineage to\nbe enlightened about their ancestral social and cultural heritage, meet\nbiological parents, and discover the geographical niche from which their\nancestral population originated. Knowing that the birth parents discarded the\nchild leaves many adoptees feeling psychologically disturbed, anonymous, and\nunheralded. The absence of ancestral information is often an unsolvable mystery\nfor many because they do not possess the skills or knowledge needed to produce a\npositive outcome. These individuals may benefit from the assistance of an\nadoption detective, or the professional skills and advice of a qualified private\ninvestigator.\n\nMedical Family History To help focus attention on the importance of medical\nfamily history, the Surgeon General, in cooperation with other agencies with the\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has launched a national public\nhealth campaign, called the Surgeon General's Family History\nInitiative, http://www.hhs.gov/familyhistory/ to encourage all\nAmerican families to learn more about their family health history. The fact that\nall living things inherit traits from their parents is information that has been\nused since prehistoric times to improve crop plants and animals through\nselective breeding. The biological science of genetics, which began with the\nwork of Gregor Mendel in the mid-nineteenth century, seeks to understand the\nprocess of inheritance and the physical basis for heredity in our DNA.\n\nWhat is known about family medical heritage can save livesâthat is why gathering\na complete and accurate medical family history is extremely important as genetic\nmedicine continues to explain more diseases. Many advances in biological medical\nscience are anticipated in the future now that the human genome has been\ndiscovered. Despite the increasing emphasis on diagnostic technology, many\nphysicians perceive the medical family history as the preeminent source of\ninformation with a much higher value in diagnosis than either the physical\nexamination or laboratory and radiography information because it is well known\nthat many medical conditions, including heart disease, breast cancer, prostate\ncancer, diabetes, alcoholism, Huntingtonâs disease, Alzheimerâs disease,\nhemophilia, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and high blood pressure all\nhave been shown to have links to our past.\n\nChildren who are orphaned, fostered or adopted, who donât have access to medical\nrecords because their parents are unknown, deceased or uncooperative, may\nbenefit from the comprehensive investigative skills of an adoption detective\nseeking to uncover medical information recorded in death certificates,\nobituaries, interviews, DNA, genealogy and ancestor websites, and old family\nletters. Even old family photos can provide visual clues to diseases such as\nobesity, skin conditions, and osteoporosis.\n\nReferences\n* Judith and Martin Land, Adoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child (2011),\n  Wheatmark Publishing, ISBN 1604945702\n* Sorosky, Arthur D., MD.
