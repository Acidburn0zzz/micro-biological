Endothelial cells, which store\nIL-8 in their storage vesicles, the Weibel-Palade bodies. In humans, the interleukin-\n8 protein is encoded by the IL8 gene.\n\nThere are many receptors of the surface membrane capable to bind IL-8; the most\nfrequently studied types are the G protein-coupled serpentine receptors CXCR1,\nand CXCR2. Expression and affinity to IL-8 is different in the two receptors\n(CXCR1 > CXCR2). Toll-like receptors are the receptors of the innate immune\nsystem. These receptors recognize antigen patterns (like LPS in gram negative\nbacteria). Through a chain of biochemical reactions, IL-8 is secreted and is an\nimportant mediator of the immune reaction in the innate immune system response.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Interleukin_8","recorded":1376428345,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cytokines"],"headings":["Function","Target cells","Clinical significance","Nomenclature","Regulation of Expression","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemokine","Macrophages","Epithelial_cells","Endothelial_cells","Weibel-Palade_bodies","Protein","Gene","G_protein-coupled_receptor","Interleukin_8_receptor,_alpha","Interleukin_8_receptor,_beta","Toll-like_receptor","Chemotaxis","Angiogenesis","Histamine","Respiratory_burst","Toll-like_receptor","Macrophages","Homodimer","Methylation","Bronchiolitis","Endothelial_cells","Macrophage","Mast_cell","Keratinocyte","Tetrahymena","Gingivitis","Psoriasis","Schizophrenia","International_Union_of_Immunological_Societies","Human_Genome_Organisation","IL8RA","IL8RB"]}
