{"cursor":"45951","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn mathematics, the 'gamma function' (represented by the capital Greek\nletter '[[gamma|Î]]') is an extension of the factorial function, with its\nargument shifted down by 1, to real and complex numbers. That is, if n is a\npositive integer:\n\n: \\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\n\nThe gamma function is defined for all complex numbers except the negative\nintegers and zero. For complex numbers with a positive real part, it is defined\nvia an improper integral that converges:\n\n: \\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t}\\,{\\rm d}t.\n\nThis integral function is extended by analytic continuation to all complex\nnumbers except the non-positive integers (where the function has simple poles),\nyielding the meromorphic function we call the gamma function.\n\nThe gamma function is a component in various probability-distribution functions,\nand as such it is applicable in the fields of probability and statistics, as\nwell as combinatorics.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"gamma_function","recorded":1376429072,"links":[],"instances":["complex_analysis","mathematics","mathematics","software","physicist","complex_analysis","programming_language","mathematician","complex_analysis","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gamma
