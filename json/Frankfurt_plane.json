{"cursor":"1745","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Frankfort plane' (also called the 'auriculo-orbital plane') was established\nat the World Congress on Anthropology in Frankfurt, Germany in 1884, and decreed\nas the anatomical position of the human skull. It was decided that a plane\npassing through the inferior margin of the left orbit (the point called the left\n'orbitale') and the upper margin of each ear canal or external auditory meatus,\na point called the porion, was most nearly parallel to the surface of the earth,\nand also close to the position the head is normally carried in the living\nsubject.\n\nNote that in the normal subject, both orbitales and both porions lie in a single\nplane. However, due to pathology, this is not always the case. The formal\ndefinition specifies only the three points listed above, sufficient to describe\na plane in three-dimensional space.\n\nFor the purposes of comparison, the skulls of other species, notably hominids\nand primates may be studied in the Frankfurt plane, but it is not considered to\nbe the anatomical position for other species.\n\nThe Frankfort plane may also be used as a reference point in related fields.\nFor example, in prosthodontics, the Frankfurt-Mandibular plane Angle (FMA) is\nthe angle formed at the intersection of the Frankfurt plane with the\nmandibular plane.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Frankfurt_plane","recorded":1376418348,"links":[],"instances":["anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Skull"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["orbit","anatomy"]],"members":["orbit"],"related":["Anthropology","Frankfurt","Germany","Anatomical_position","Human_skull","Orbit_(anatomy)","Porion","Earth","Hominids","Primates","Prosthodontics","Mandibular_plane","Reid's_base_line","Stadiometer"]}
