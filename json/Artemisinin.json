Treatments containing an\nartemisinin derivative (artemisinin-combination therapies, ACTs) are now\nstandard treatment worldwide for P. falciparum malaria. The starting compound\nartemisinin is isolated from the plant [[Artemisia annua]], sweet wormwood, a\nherb employed in Chinese traditional medicine.\n\nChemically, artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone containing an unusual\nperoxide bridge. This peroxide is believed to be responsible for the drug's\nmechanism of action. Few other natural compounds with such a peroxide bridge are\nknown. (Ascaridole is another.)\n\nUse of the drug by itself as a monotherapy is explicitly discouraged by the\nWorld Health Organization, as there have been signs that malarial parasites are\ndeveloping resistance to the drug. Therapies that combine artemisinin with some\nother antimalarial drug are the preferred treatment for malaria and are both\neffective and well tolerated in patients. The drug is also increasingly being\nused in [[Plasmodium vivax]] malaria, as well as being a topic of\nresearch in cancer treatment.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Artemisinin","recorded":1376428642,"links":[],"instances":["chemistry","company","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Antimalarial agents","Chinese inventions","Experimental cancer drugs","Chemical compounds found in Asteraceae","Organic peroxides","Sesquiterpene lactones","Trioxanes","Oxygen heterocycles"],"headings":["History","Artemisinin derivatives","Indications","Resistance","Adverse effects","Mechanism of action","Dosing","Production and price","Synthesis","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["derivative","chemistry"],["radical","chemistry"],["amyris","company"],["amyris","company"]],"members":["derivative","amyris","radical"],"related":["Chinese_language","Medication","Malaria","Artemisinin-combination_therapy","Chinese_traditional_medicine","Sesquiterpene_lactone","Peroxide","Ascaridole","Monotherapy","World_Health_Organization","Herbalist","Wushi'er_bingfang","Mawangdui","Antimalarial_drug","Ge_Hong","Potomac_River","Washington,_D.C.","People's_Liberation_Army","Drug_discovery","Mao_Zedong","Tu_Youyou","Chinese_medicine","Malaria","Lumefantrine","Piperaquine","Pyronaridine","Chinese_economic_reform","Peroxide","Novartis","Artemether","Lumefantrine","World_Health_Organisation","Lasker-DeBakey_Clinical_Medical_Research_Award","Nobel_Prize","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Bioavailability","Derivative_(chemistry)","Artesunate","Artemether","Dihydroartemisinin","Artelinic_acid","Artenimol","Artemotil","Arterolane","Piperaquine","Recrudescence","WHO","Mefloquine","Lumefantrine","Coartem","Amodiaquine","ASAQ","Piperaquine","Pyronaridine","Good_manufacturing_practice","Half-life","Quinine","Experimental_cancer_treatment","Cancer","Hepatoma","Organic_peroxide","Lactone","Reactive_oxygen_species","Angiogenesis","Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor","Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced_protein_1","Oxidative_stress","Anthelmintics","Schistosomiasis","Schistosoma","Trematodes","WHO","Hepatitis","Prodrugs","Metabolite","Dihydroartemisinin","Red_blood_cell","Hemoglobin","Redox","Peroxide","High-valent_iron","Radical_(chemistry)","Cysteine_protease","Hemozoin","Electron_microscopy","SERCA","PfATP6","Electron_transport_chain","Mitochondria","Hexane","Novartis","Sanofi-Aventis","University_of_York","World_Agroforestry_Centre","Mozambique","Médecins_sans_frontières","Jay_Keasling","University_of_California,_Berkeley","Amyris_(company)","Photochemical","Mevalonate_pathway","Farnesyl_diphosphate","Non-mevalonate_pathway","Methoxymethyl_ether","Desilylation","Photo-oxygenation","Flow_chemistry","Photochemistry","Singlet_oxygen","Synthetic_biology","Mevalonate_pathway","Amorpha-4,11-diene_synthase","Cytochrome_P450","Monooxygenase","Amorpha-4,11-diene","Amyris_(company)","Institute_for_OneWorld_Health","Bill_&_Melinda_Gates_Foundation","Sanofi-aventis","Wageningen_University"]}
