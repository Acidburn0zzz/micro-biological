They are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that\ninhabit the forests of central Africa. The genus is divided into two species and\neither four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of\na human, from 95â99% depending on what is counted, and they are the next closest\nliving relatives to humans after the bonobo and common chimpanzee.\n\nGorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Africa.\nAlthough their range covers a small percentage of Africa, gorillas cover a wide\nrange of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane\ncloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from . Lowland\ngorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea\nlevel, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries\nand eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near\nits border with Rwanda.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"gorilla","recorded":1376428935,"links":[],"instances":["gorilla","writer","gorilla","gorilla","zoology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Apes","Gorillas|","Mammals of Africa","Megafauna of Africa","Herbivorous animals","Sequenced genomes"],"headings":["Etymology","Evolution and classification","Physical characteristics","Behavior and ecology","Intelligence","Interactions with humans","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["infanticide","zoology"],["jenny","gorilla"],["colo","gorilla"],["koko","gorilla"],["mary_bradley","writer"]],"members":["koko","mary_bradley","colo","jenny","infanticide"],"related":["Western_gorilla","Animal","Chordate","Mammal","Primate","Hominoidea","Hominidae","Homininae","Isidore_Geoffroy_Saint-Hilaire","Thomas_S._Savage","Species","Eponym","Extant_taxon","Genus","Primate","Herbivorous","Ape","Forest","Africa","Subspecies","DNA","Human_evolutionary_genetics","Human","Bonobo","Chimpanzee","Africa","Mountain_gorilla","Albertine_Rift_montane_forests","Cloud_forest","Virunga_Mountains","Sea_level","Western_lowland_gorilla","Eastern_lowland_gorilla","Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","Rwanda","Thomas_S._Savage","Jeffries_Wyman","Western_gorilla","Liberia","Hanno_the_Navigator","Carthage","Sierra_Leone","Gene_copy_number","Ice_Age","Primatology","Western_gorilla","Western_lowland_gorilla","Cross_River_gorilla","Eastern_gorilla","Mountain_gorilla","Eastern_lowland_gorilla","Trinomen","Bwindi_gorilla","Knuckle-walking","Mandibular_prognathism","Mandible","Maxilla","Sagittal_crest","Monoclonal_antibodies","Type_O_blood","ABO_blood_group_system","Congo_River","Tributary","Montane_forest","Leopard","Infanticide_(zoology)","Animal_architecture","Tool_use","Bonobo","Dallas_Zoo","Jenny_(gorilla)","Associated_Press","Colo_(gorilla)","Columbus_Zoo_and_Aquarium","Animal_communication","Aggression","Ritual","Koko_(gorilla)","Sign_language","Great_ape","Color_preferences","Wildlife_Conservation_Society","Tool","Nouabalé-Ndoki_National_Park","Republic_of_Congo","Swamp","Great_ape","Republic_of_Congo","Chimpanzee","Ape","Hanno_the_Navigator","Carthaginian","African","Carthaginians","Thomas_Staughton_Savage","Liberia","Africa","Jeffries_Wyman","Western_gorilla","Paul_du_Chaillu","Africa","Carl_Akeley","American_Museum_of_Natural_History","Mary_Bradley_(writer)","James_Tiptree_Jr.","Robert_Yerkes","World_War_II","George_Schaller","Louis_Leakey","Dian_Fossey","Western_lowland_gorilla","Zoonotic","HIV/AIDS","Simian_immunodeficiency_virus","Endangered_species","IUCN_Red_List","Critically_Endangered","Habitat_destruction","Poaching","Bushmeat","Odzala_National_Park","Republic_of_Congo","Ebola_virus","Extinction","Great_Apes_Survival_Project","United_Nations_Environment_Programme","UNESCO","Gorilla_agreement","Bonn_Convention","Gorilla_agreement","Pulp_magazines","Tarzan","Conan_the_Barbarian","Bili_ape","Gorilla_suit","List_of_apes","List_of_fictional_apes","International_Gorilla_Conservation_Programme"]}
