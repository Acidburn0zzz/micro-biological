Using this approach, synthetic biologists have demonstrated the ability\nof their gene networks to perform Boolean computation, to hold a memory, and to\ngenerate pulses and oscillation.\n\nSynthetic morphology extends this idea by adding output modules that alter the\nshape or social behaviour of cells in response to the state of the artificial\ngene network. For example, instead of just making a fluorescent protein, a gene\nnetwork may switch on an adhesion molecule so that cells stick to each other, or\nactivate a motility system so that cells move. It has been argued that the\nformation of properly-shaped tissues by mammalian cells involves mainly a set of\nabout ten basic cellular events (cell proliferation, cell death, cell adhesion,\ndifferential adhesion, cell de-adhesion, cell fusion, cell locomotion,\nchemotaxis, haptotaxis, cell wedging).

PMID 18510501 Broadly similar lists exist\nfor tissues of plants, fungi etc. In principle, therefore, a fairly small set of\noutput modules might allow biotechnologists to 'program' cells to produce artificially-\ndesigned arrangements, shapes and eventually 'tissues'.\n\nThe term synthetic morphology was introduced to the peer reviewed scientific\nliterature in 2008  and is now becoming more widely used\nboth in peer-reviewed literature Tanaka H, Yi TM (2009)\nSynthetic morphology using alternative inputs.
