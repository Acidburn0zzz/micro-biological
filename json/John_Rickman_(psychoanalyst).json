{"cursor":"5397","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nJohn Rickman (10 April 1891 - 1 July 1951) was an English psychoanalyst.\n\nJohn Rickman was the only child in an extended Quaker family and was throughout\nhis life a practicing Quaker. His father ran an ironmongerâs shop in Dorking and\ndied of tuberculosis when John was 2. His mother never remarried, and the main\nmale influences in his early life were his grandfathers. Johnâs maternal\ngrandfather was often unkind to him, something he recalled years later when in\nanalysis with Sandor Ferenczi. Rickman studied Natural Sciences at Kingâs\nCollege, Cambridge, followed by Medicine at St Thomasâs Hospital in London,\nduring which time the First World War broke out. As a conscientious objector he\nrefused to join up, finishing his training instead. In 1916 Rickman joined âthe\nFriendsâ War Victims Relief Serviceâ in the Samara province of South Russia,\nwhere there was great poverty and deprivation, and the Czar still ruled. There\nhe taught peasant women how to nurse typhoid patients during an epidemic and\nmade anthropological observations of the severe limitations of village life. In\n1917 Rickman met an American social worker Lydia Cooper Lewis, who had just\njoined the Relief Service unit. John and Lydia married in Samara the following\nspring, after the revolution, and then set off on a dramatic and dangerous\nescape from the new regime, arriving at Vladivostok after more than three months\non a very slow trans-Siberian railway journey, frequently stopped and searched\nby rival agents of the civil war. Once home, Rickman worked as a medical officer\nwith psychiatric patients at Fulbourn Hospital in Cambridge. In Cambridge he met\nW. H. R. Rivers (1864â1922), an anthropologist and physician who had treated\nsoldiers traumatized by the war at Craiglockhart Hospital in Edinburgh. Rivers\nadvised Rickman to seek an analysis with Freud.\n\nIn 1919 Rickman went to Vienna to have analysis with Freud. He made many\ncontacts there, including Karl Abraham (1877â1925) and Sandor Ferenczi\n(1873â1933), He continued with Freud until 1922, when he qualified as a\npsychoanalyst. In 1928 he travelled to Budapest to have treatment from Ferenczi.\nIn 1934 Rickman began an analysis with Melanie Klein that was to continue,\nintermittently, until 1941 and again for some sessions after the war. In 1938 Dr\nWilfred Bion, who had been working as a psychotherapist at the Tavistock Clinic,\nasked Rickman to be his training psychoanalyst. This was brought to a premature\nend by the onset of the second world war.\n\n At the beginning of 1940 Rickman was sent to Wharncliffe Hospital near\n Sheffield, where his work attracted considerable interest and admiration from\n army psychologists and psychiatrists, including Wilfred Bion, who visited him\n there. As a result of this reunion Bion drafted what came to be known as the\n Wharncliffe Memorandum, of which no copy has survived. It contained some of the\n first ideas on what was to become after the war the therapeutic community\n movement. Rickman joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) and with the rank\n of major was posted to Northfield Military Hospital near Birmingham in July\n 1942. Most of the patients there were soldiers who could not manage army life.\n Rickmanâs approach was thoughtful, practical and hopeful, not typical of army\n psychiatrists of the day. Wilfred Bion asked to be transferred to Northfield\n and arrived in September of the same year. Here he initiated what has since\n been seen as a revolutionary experiment with groups which, though it lasted\n only six weeks, led to developments in the understanding and management of\n groups, not only in mental health but in public services and organisations.\n\nOver three decades Rickman played an important part in the foundation and\ndevelopment of the British Psychoanalytical Society, and later, behind the\nscenes, in building a bridge between it and the Tavistock Clinic. He was the\neditor of the ï¿¼British Journal of Medical Psychology from 1935 to 1949 and\npublished a great deal (Rickman 1957). Most of his writing after the First World\nWar was infused with psychoanalysis, but his experiences in Russia and\nCambridge, and his Quaker commitment to social justice, sexual equality and non-\nviolence, put him ahead of his time. At the end of the war Rickman renewed his\ninvolvement in the British Psychoanalytical Society and was elected president\nfrom 1947 to 1950. He died on July,1 1951, aged only 60.\n\nEdited excerpts from Kraemer, S (2011)âThe dangers of this atmosphereâ: a Quaker\nconnection in the Tavistock Clinicâs development.
