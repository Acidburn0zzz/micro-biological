The airlines did not warn passengers and it was only in the\nearly 1990s that the link between long flights and deep vein thrombosis was\nmade public.\n\nBeighton undertook clinical research in the Sahara Desert and epidemiologic\nstudies on Easter Island, Tristan da Cunha and in Southern Africa. In 1972,\nBeighton was appointed Professor of Human Genetics at the University of Cape\nTown's Faculty of Medicine. His research was largely on inherited disorders of\nthe skeleton and connective tissues.\n\nBeighton has received several awards including the gold medal of the British\nOrthopaedic Association, the President's Medallion of the South African\nOrthopaedic Association, the Smith & Nephew literary award and the silver medal\nof the South African Medical Research Council.
