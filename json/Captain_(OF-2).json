{"cursor":"9669","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe army rank of 'captain' (from the French capitaine) is a commissioned officer\nrank historically corresponding to command of a company of soldiers. The rank is\nalso used by some air forces and marine forces. Today a captain is typically\neither the commander or second-in-command of a company or artillery battery (or\nUnited States Army cavalry troop or Commonwealth squadron). In the Chinese\nPeople's Liberation Army, a captain may also command a company, or be the second-in-\ncommand of a battalion.\n\nIn NATO countries the rank of captain is described by the code OF-2 and is one\nrank above an OF-1 (lieutenant or first lieutenant) and one below an OF-3 (major\nor commandant). The rank of captain is generally considered to be the highest\nrank a soldier can achieve while remaining in the field.\n\nThe rank of captain should not be confused with the naval rank of captain or\nwith the British-influenced air force rank of group captain, both of which are\nequivalent to the army rank of colonel.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Captain_(OF-2)","recorded":1376427943,"links":[],"instances":["united_states","armed_forces","army","country","military_unit","armed_services","rank"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Military ranks","Military ranks of Australia","Military ranks of Canada","Military ranks of India","Military ranks of Ireland","Military ranks of Pakistan","Military ranks of Russia","Military ranks of Singapore","Military ranks of Sweden"],"headings":["History","Air forces","Equivalent Captain ranks","Insignia","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["officer","armed_forces"],["company","military_unit"],["marine","armed_services"],["squadron","army"],["commandant","rank"],["captain","naval"],["macedonia","country"],["captain","of-2"],["company","military_unit"],["lieutenant","u.s._navy"],["captain","british_army_and_royal_marines"],["captain","united_states"]],"members":["lieutenant","captain","officer","squadron","macedonia","company","marine","commandant"],"related":["Officer_(armed_forces)","Company_(military_unit)","Air_force","Marine_(armed_services)","Second-in-command","Artillery_battery","United_States_Army","Armoured_cavalry","Troop","Commonwealth_of_Nations","Squadron_(army)","People's_Republic_of_China","People's_Liberation_Army","Company","Battalion","Lieutenant","First_lieutenant","Major","Commandant_(rank)","Captain_(naval)","Group_captain","Colonel","French_Revolution","Lieutenant","Air_force","United_States_Air_Force","United_Kingdom","Royal_Air_Force","Commonwealth_of_Nations","Egyptian_Air_Force","Hellenic_Air_Force","Royal_Air_Force_of_Oman","Royal_Thai_Air_Force","Air_Force_of_Zimbabwe","Flight_lieutenant","Group_captain","Canadian_Forces","Royal_Canadian_Air_Force","Epaulette","Lieutenant","Executive_curl","Colonel","Mongolia","France","Belgium","Italy","Brasil","Croatia","Portugal","Austria","Germany","Spain","Switzerland","Nazi_SS","Afghanistan","Serbia","Bulgaria","Poland","Philippines","Russia","Ukraine","Czechia","Slovakia","Netherlands","Belgium","Denmark","Pakistan","Finland","Lithuania","Macedonia_(country)","Norway","Sweden","Indonesia","Greece","Thailand","Thailand","Israel","People's_Republic_of_China","Republic_of_China","Hungary","South_Korea","Japan","Turkey","Vietnam","Israel_Defense_Force","Captain_(OF-2)","Company_(military_unit)","Artillery_battery","Officer_Commanding","Major","Second_Lieutenant","Lieutenant","Belgian_Land_Component","Egyptian_Army_ranks","Finnish_Defence_Force","Hellenic_Army","Hungarian_Defence_Force","Italian_Army","Lithuanian_Land_Force","Army_of_the_Republic_of_Macedonia","Polish_Army","Romanian_Armed_Forces","Armed_Forces_of_the_Russian_Federation","Swedish_Air_Force","Swedish_Army","Lieutenant_(U.S._Navy)","Ranks_and_insignia_of_the_Confederate_States","Captain_(British_Army_and_Royal_Marines)","Captain_(United_States)"]}
