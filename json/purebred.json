When the\nlineage of a purebred animal is recorded, that animal is said to be pedigreed.\n\nThe term purebred is occasionally confused with the proper noun\n[[Thoroughbred]], which refers exclusively to a specific breed of horse, one of\nthe first breeds for which a written national stud book was created since the\n18th century. Thus a purebred animal should never be called a \"thoroughbred\"\nunless the animal actually is a registered Thoroughbred horse.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"purebred","recorded":1376428040,"links":[],"instances":["cat","cat","biology","dog"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animal breeding","Livestock"],"headings":["True breeding","Pedigrees","Purebreds by animal","Wild species, landraces, and purebred species","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["manx","cat"],["siamese","cat"],["hybrid","biology"],["purebred","dog"]],"members":["manx","siamese","hybrid","purebred"],"related":["Species","Selective_breeding","Pedigree_chart","List_of_horse_breeds","Horse","Breed_registry","Selective_breeding","Breed","Inbreeding","Inbreeding_depression","Gene_pool","Inbreeding","Hybrid_vigor","Breed_registry","Bedouin","Arabian_peninsula","Arabian_horse","Oral_tradition","Asil","Anglo-Arabian","Thoroughbred","Arabian_horse","Dog_breed","Foundation_bloodstock","Dog_type","Landrace","Domestication_of_the_horse","Horse","Landrace","Crossbreeding","Breed_registry","Europe","List_of_horse_breeds","Andalusian_horse","Arabian_horse","MtDNA","Y-chromosome","Genealogy","Purebred_cat","List_of_cat_breeds","Breed_type","Breed_standard","Domestic_long-haired_cat","Domestic_short-haired_cat","Manx_(cat)","Siamese_(cat)","Chartreux","Turkish_Angora","Angus_cattle","Farm","Breed_registry","Cattle","Sheep","Goat","Rabbit","Pig","Artificial_insemination","Embryo_transfer","Livestock","Domesticated","Crossbreeding","Natural_selection","Selective_breeding","Artificial_selection","Landrace","Domesticated","Wildness","Feral","Hybrid_(biology)","Genetic_pollution","Wildlife","Animal_husbandry","Breed","Breed_registry","Cat_breed","Open_stud_book","Closed_stud_book","Consanguinity","Crossbreeding","Dog_breed","Dog_breeding","Dog_hybrids_and_crossbreeds","Endogamy","Horse_breeding","Inbreeding","Mixed-breed_dog","Pedigreed_animal_documentation","Purebred_(dog)"]}
