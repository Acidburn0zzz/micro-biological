{"cursor":"4068","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Lydia Fairchild' and her children are the subjects of a British documentary\ncalled The Twin Inside Me (also known as \"I Am My Own Twin\").\n\nLydia Fairchild was pregnant with her third child when she and the father of her\nchildren, Jamie Townsend, separated. When Fairchild applied for welfare support\nin 2002, she was requested to provide DNA evidence that Townsend was the father\nof her children. While the results showed Townsend was certainly the father of\nthe children, the DNA tests indicated that she was not their mother.\n\nThis resulted in Fairchild's being taken to court for fraud for claiming\nbenefit for other people's children or taking part in a surrogacy scam.\nHospital records of her prior births were disregarded. Prosecutors called for\nher two children to be taken into care. As time came for her to give birth to\nher third child, the judge ordered a witness be present at the birth. This\nwitness was to ensure that blood samples were immediately taken from both the\nchild and Fairchild. Two weeks later, DNA tests indicated that she was not the\nmother of that child either.\n\nA breakthrough came when a lawyer for the prosecution found an article in the\n[[The New England Journal of Medicine|New England Journal of Medicine]] about a\nsimilar case involving a woman called Karen Keegan that had happened in\nBoston. He realised that Fairchild's case might also be caused by\nchimerism. Fairchild's prosecutors suggested this possibility to her lawyers,\nwho arranged further testing. As in Keegan's case, DNA samples were taken from\nmembers of the extended family. The DNA of Fairchild's children matched that of\nFairchild's mother to the extent expected of a grandmother. They also found\nthat, although the DNA in Fairchild's skin and hair did not match her\nchildren's, the DNA from a cervical smear test did match. Fairchild was carrying\ntwo different sets of DNA, the defining characteristic of a chimera.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Lydia_Fairchild","recorded":1376421953,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Lydia_Fairchild&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lydia_Fairchild&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","#cite_note-1","/wiki/DNA_profiling","/wiki/Surrogacy#United_Kingdom","/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Chimera_(genetics)","/wiki/Pap_test","/wiki/Chimera_(genetics)","/w/index.php?title=Lydia_Fairchild&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://web.archive.org/web/20060526105634/http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/","/wiki/Five_(TV_channel)","http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/","#cite_ref-2","http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa013452","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1056%2FNEJMoa013452","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12015394","/w/index.php?title=Lydia_Fairchild&action=edit&section=2","http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2315693","http://ace.mu.nu/archives/118606.php","http://www.katewerk.com/chimera.html","http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/M/Mosaics.html#TetragameticHuman","http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1392149","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lydia_Fairchild&oldid=554342395","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1976_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Molecular_biology","/wiki/Category:Applied_genetics","/wiki/Category:Personal_identification_documents","/wiki/Category:Science_and_law","/wiki/Category:Biometrics","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Lydia+Fairchild&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Lydia+Fairchild","/wiki/Lydia_Fairchild","/wiki/Talk:Lydia_Fairchild","#","/wiki/Lydia_Fairchild","/w/index.php?title=Lydia_Fairchild&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lydia_Fairchild&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Lydia_Fairchild","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Lydia_Fairchild","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Lydia_Fairchild&oldid=554342395","/w/index.php?title=Lydia_Fairchild&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1601338","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Lydia_Fairchild&id=554342395","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Lydia+Fairchild","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Lydia+Fairchild&oldid=554342395&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Lydia_Fairchild&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Fairchild","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1601338#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Fairchild","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1976
