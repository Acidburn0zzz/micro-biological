They range in diameter from a minimum of to a maximum of\n, with most designs in diameter. Footing is usually\nsand or other soft dirt. The sides are high, traditionally\nmade of wooden posts with rails or wooden boards, modern round pens are often\nmade out of portable pipe panels that allow the pen to be made bigger or\nsmaller, or to be moved.\n\nDesigns vary. Traditional designs intended for control of untamed feral horses\nare made of heavy lumber and up to high, to prevent the animal from jumping out\nor running through the fence. Traditional round pens have closely spaced rails\nthat allow foot room for a human to climb out of the pen, but also give the\nfence great strength and also discourage the animal from seeking escape due to\nthe near-solid appearance of closely spaced rails. Most modern round pens,\nhowever, are intended for domesticated horses who do not fear humans. These\ndesigns commonly are built about high, which still discourages jumping out, but\nuse fewer materials and are less expensive. There are two common modern designs.\nOne, made of pipe, planks or round rails, resembles a traditional fence, with\nfewer rails than a traditional type, as the modern domestic horse usually\nrespects fences and does not consider the normal gaps between fence rails to\noffer a means of escape. In this design, the bottom section of the fence may be\nsolid to prevent the sand or loose dirt from being pushed out of the pen by the\nmovement of the animal. The other design, sometimes called a \"bullpen,\" has\ncompletely solid walls, usually plywood placed over\ntraditional rails or planks, to completely block all outside visual distractions\nand to allow the horse to concentrate on the handler. Sometimes the walls of a\nbullpen slant outward slightly. The solid-walled design may also reduce wind,\nand thus allow work in more inclement weather than a more open design. The\ndrawback to a bullpen design is that the solid, smooth walls hinder a human's\nescape from the pen by climbing over the fence if needed.\n\nMost round pens are located outdoors, but due to their relatively small size can\neasily be enclosed by a roof or a tension fabric building. Round pens made of\nportable panels are sometimes set up within a larger riding arena allowing one\nhorse to be worked in the round pen while others may still ride along the rail\nof the larger area.\n\nThe round pen has historic roots dating to the tradition of Spanish horsemanship\nand probably even earlier antecedents. In North America, it was used for horse-\nbreaking Mexico and came north with the vaqueros to be adopted by cowboys in the\nwestern United States. Today the round pen is used in Europe for some forms of\nclassical dressage training and in the Americas as a common tool of western\nriding training methodology that is particularly popular with the natural\nhorsemanship movement.\n\n\nThe round pen allows greater interaction between horse and handler and more\ncontrol over the horse because it cannot fully avoid its human handler. It is used for many forms of training,\nincluding ground work such as longeing and liberty work, or for riding. If may\nalso be used for turnout and free exercise. It is most often used today for the\npurpose of training young horses, though is also used for exercising or riding\nmature horses and a place for the first rides of a beginning rider who is\ncontrolling his or her own horse for the first time. More experienced horses\nmay be ridden in a round pen in situations where control or focus are\nparticularly desired.\n","linknr":117,"url":"round_pen","recorded":1376429042,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Round_pen&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Round_pen&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_pen","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Solid_round_pen.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Solid_round_pen.jpg/220px-Solid_round_pen.jpg","/wiki/File:Solid_round_pen.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:RH-rechtehand-scherkraftHH.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/RH-rechtehand-scherkraftHH.jpg/220px-RH-rechtehand-scherkraftHH.jpg","/wiki/File:RH-rechtehand-scherkraftHH.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Pen_(enclosure)","/wiki/Horse_training","#cite_note-Belknap-1","#cite_note-Belknap-1","/w/index.php?title=Pipe_panel&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Feral_horse","/wiki/Domestication_of_the_horse","#cite_note-Belknap-1","/wiki/Plywood","/wiki/Tension_fabric_building","/wiki/Arena","/wiki/Vaquero","/wiki/Cowboy","/wiki/Classical_dressage","/wiki/Western_riding","/wiki/Natural_horsemanship","/wiki/File:Azimut_play.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Azimut_play.jpg/220px-Azimut_play.jpg","/wiki/File:Azimut_play.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","#cite_note-Thomas-2","#cite_note-Belknap-1","/wiki/Longeing","/wiki/Equestrianism","/w/index.php?title=Round_pen&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Round_pen&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Bullpen","/w/index.php?title=Round_pen&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Round_pen&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-Belknap_1-0","#cite_ref-Belknap_1-1","#cite_ref-Belknap_1-2","#cite_ref-Belknap_1-3","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-57076-274-0","#cite_ref-Thomas_2-0","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9781603425445","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Round_pen&oldid=560331472","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Horse_training","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Round+pen&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Round+pen","/wiki/Round_pen","/wiki/Talk:Round_pen","#","/wiki/Round_pen","/w/index.php?title=Round_pen&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Round_pen&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Round_pen&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Round_pen","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Round_pen","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Round_pen&oldid=560331472","/w/index.php?title=Round_pen&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7371203","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Round_pen&id=560331472","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Round+pen","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Round+pen&oldid=560331472&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Round_pen&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7371203#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer",
