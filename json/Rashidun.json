The concept of \"Rightly Guided Caliphs\" originated\nwith the later Abbasid Dynasty, which was based in Baghdad. It is a reference to\nthe Sunni tradition, \"Hold firmly to my example (sunnah) and that of the Rightly\nGuided Caliphs\" (Ibn Majah, Abu Dawood). [http://www.inter-\nislam.org/Actions/taraweeh.htm Taraweeh: 8 or 20? ] The implication of the term is that later caliphs were less \"righteous\"\nand perhaps lesser examples of Muslim piety.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Rashidun","recorded":1376427674,"links":[],"instances":["tribe"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Articles about multiple people","Rashidun|*","Rashidun Caliphate","Sunni Islam","Sahabah"],"headings":["History","Military expansion","Social policies","Muslim views","Timeline","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["muslim_conquest_of_persia#conquest_of_persia","642–644"],["quraysh","tribe"]],"members":["quraysh"],"related":["Sunni","Islam","Caliph","Muhammad","Rashidun_Caliphate","Abu_Bakr","Umar","Uthman","Ali","Abbasid_Dynasty","Baghdad","Sunnah","Ibn_Majah","Abu_Dawood","Muhammad","Election","The_election_of_Uthman","Islamic_democracy","Abu_Bakr","Umar_ibn_al-Khattab","Uthman_ibn_Affan","Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib","Umar_ibn_Abdul_Aziz","Umayyad","Taftazani","Ibadhi","Suleiman_the_Magnificent","Abdul_Hamid_I","Ottoman_Empire","Caliphs","Ibn_Hajr_al-Asqalani","Bani_Abbas","Abbassids","Islamic_Prophet","Muhammad","Rashidun_Caliphate","Encyclopædia_Britannica","Ridda","Dhu_al-Hijjah","Islamic_calendar","Prophets_of_Islam","Muhammad","Caliph","Abu_Bakr","Muslim_conquests","Sassanid_Empire","Eastern_Roman_Empire","Persian_people","Sahabah","Islamic_prophet","Muhammad","Umayyad_Caliphate","Mecca","Quraysh_(tribe)","Iran","Greater_Khorasan","Afghanistan","Armenia","Qur'an","Qur'an","Qur'an","Qur'an","Malik_ibn_Ashter","Kufa","Iraq","Syria","Damascus","Muawiyah_I","Syria","Uthman","First_Fitna","Muawiyah_I","Ramadan","Muslim_conquest_of_Persia","Muslim_conquest_of_Syria","Arab_conquest_of_Armenia","Muslim_conquest_of_Egypt","Byzantine–Sassanid_War_of_602–628","Canal","Saad_canal","Abi_Musa_Canal","Basra","Umar_ibn_al-Khattab","Nile","Kaaba","Basra","Midian","Umar","Kufa","Fustat","Mosul","Sunni_Muslims","Shia_Muslims","Muslim_leaders","Sunni_Islam","Western_world","Sahaba","Muhammad","Order_of_succession","Inheritance","Umayyad_Caliphate","Shi'a_Islam","Ali","Shi'a_Imam","Shi'a_Muslims","Hadith_of_the_pond_of_Khumm","Ali","Muhammad","Aaron","Moses","Muhammad","Ali","Muhammad","Hasan_ibn_Ali","Husayn_ibn_Ali","Shi'a","Shi'a","Sunnah","Taraweeh","Adhan","Abu_Bakr","Umar_ibn_al-Khattab","Uthman_ibn_Affan","Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib","The_Four_Companions","The_Ten_Promised_Paradise","Sunni_view_of_the_Sahaba"]}
