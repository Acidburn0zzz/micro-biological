{"cursor":"65947","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Vacuum' is space that is empty of matter. The word stems from the Latin\nadjective vacuus for \"vacant\" or \"void\". An approximation to such vacuum is a\nregion with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure. Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would\noccur in a perfect vacuum, which they sometimes simply call \"vacuum\" or 'free\nspace', and use the term 'partial vacuum' to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum\nas one might have in a laboratory or in space. The Latin term 'in vacuo' is used\nto describe an object as being in what would otherwise be a vacuum.\n\nThe quality of a partial vacuum refers to how closely it approaches a perfect\nvacuum. Other things equal, lower gas pressure means higher-quality vacuum. For\nexample, a typical vacuum cleaner produces enough suction to reduce air pressure\nby around 20%. Note that 1 inch of water is â0.0025 atm. Much higher-\nquality vacuums are possible. Ultra-high vacuum chambers, common in chemistry,\nphysics, and engineering, operate below one trillionth (10 â12 ) of\natmospheric pressure (100 nPa), and can reach around 100\nparticles/cm 3. Outer space is an even higher-\nquality vacuum, with the equivalent of just a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter\non average. {{cite journal\n | last=Tadokoro | first=M. | title=A Study of the Local Group by Use of the\n | Virial Theorem journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan\n | volume=20 | page=230 | year=1968 bibcode=1968PASJ...20..230T }} This source\n | estimates a density of for the Local Group.

Evangelista\nTorricelli produced the first laboratory vacuum in 1643, and other experimental\ntechniques were developed as a result of his theories of atmospheric pressure. A\n'torricellian vacuum' is created by filling with mercury a tall glass container\nclosed at one end and then inverting the container into a bowl to contain the\nmercury.

The recent development of human\nspaceflight has raised interest in the impact of vacuum on human health, and on\nlife forms in general.
