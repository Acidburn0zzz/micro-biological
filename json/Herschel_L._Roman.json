{"cursor":"6203","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Herschel Lewis Roman' (September 29, 1914 â€“ July\n2, 1989) was a geneticist famous for popularizing the use of yeast in genetic\nresearch. The obituary says Roman died \"Sunday\", which was\nJuly 2.\n\nRoman was born in Szumsk in eastern Poland on September 29, 1914. His father had moved to the United States, intending to bring\nHerschel and his mother, but they were not able to travel until 1921 because of\nWorld War I. After that, he spent his early years in northern Minnesota and\nWisconsin, then in St. Louis, where they had sent Herschel in\nadvance to provide him with an urban high school education.\nHe enrolled at the University of Missouri in 1932 and, majoring in chemistry and\nminoring in physics, graduated in 1936. During his senior year, he met Lewis Stadler. For his\ngraduate studies, Roman became Stadler's graduate student and switched to\ngenetics.\n\nIn 1942 Roman received his Ph.D. in genetics from the University of\nMissouri, moved to Seattle in\nSeptember, and joined the faculty of the Department of Botany\nat the University of Washington, where he stayed for the rest of his career. Around 1944, during World\nWar II, he entered the Army Air Force, became a captain, and then returned to\nthe University of Washington in 1946. He started studying\nthe cytogenetics of maize, experimenting with their supernumerary B chromosomes,\nbut found that the maize with \"interesting\" genes were not hardy enough to grow\nwest of the Cascade Mountains. After\ndifficult experiences with growing maize in a greenhouse, going to the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology each summer from 1946 to 1948, and growing\ncorn in Cle Elum, Washington to get east of the Cascades,\nRoman decided to switch to studying [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] instead. He invited Carl Lindegren, faculty member at Washington University\nin St. Louis and the only yeast geneticist in the United States, to visit the\nUniversity of Washington. From then on, Roman's concentration\nwas on yeast genetics.\n\nIn 1952 and 1956, Roman spent sabbaticals\nin Paris working with Boris Ephrussi. The University of Washington established\nits Department of Genetics in June 1959, with Roman as chairman; he held the\nseat until August 1980. \n\nRoman, who fellow yeast geneticist Geovanni Magni declared to be the \"Pope of\nyeast genetics\", received numerous honors during his career.\nHe was president of the Genetics Society of America in 1968 and received its\nThomas Hunt Morgan Medal in 1985, and was elected to the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1969 and the National Academy of\nSciences in 1970. He also received honorary doctorates from\nPierre and Marie Curie University (University of Paris 6) and the University of\nMissouri. He was also the founding editor\nof the [[Annual Review of Genetics]].\n\nRoman suffered a stroke in January 1976. He remained active\nin research until his death from stroke at Swedish Hospital\nin Seattle, Washington, on July 2, 1989, aged 74.\n","linknr":212,"url":"Herschel_L._Roman","recorded":1376425927,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Herschel_L._Roman&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Herschel_L._Roman&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herschel_L._Roman","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","#cite_note-g-126-1","/wiki/Geneticist","/wiki/Yeast","/wiki/Genetic_research","#cite_note-nyt-obit-2","/wiki/Szumsk","/wiki/Poland","#cite_note-nap-3","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Minnesota","/wiki/Wisconsin","#cite_note-nap-3","/wiki/St._Louis","/wiki/High_school","#cite_note-g-126-1","/wiki/University_of_Missouri","#cite_note-g-126-1","#cite_note-uw50-4","/wiki/Lewis_Stadler","/wiki/Graduate_student","#cite_note-g-126-1","/wiki/Ph.D.","#cite_note-nyt-obit-2","#cite_note-uw50-4","#cite_note-uw50-4","/wiki/University_of_Washington","#cite_note-g-126-1","#cite_note-uw50-4","#cite_note-uw50-4","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces","/wiki/Captain_(land)","#cite_note-g-126-1","/wiki/Cytogenetics","/wiki/Maize","/wiki/B_chromosome","/wiki/Cascade_Mountains","#cite_note-g-126-1","#cite_note-uw50-4","/wiki/Greenhouse","/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology","/wiki/Cle_Elum,_Washington","#cite_note-uw50-4","/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae","#cite_note-nap-3","/w/index.php?title=Carl_Lindegren&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis","#cite_note-uw50-4","#cite_note-g-126-1","#cite_note-uw50-4","/wiki/Sabbatical","/wiki/Boris_Ephrussi","#cite_note-g-126-1","#cite_note-uw50-4","#cite_note-g-126-1","/wiki/Genetics_Society_of_America","/wiki/Thomas_Hunt_Morgan_Medal","#cite_note-nap-3","/wiki/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences","/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","#cite_note-nap-3","/wiki/Honorary_doctorate","/wiki/Pierre_and_Marie_Curie_University","/wiki/University_of_Paris","/wiki/University_of_Missouri","#cite_note-g-126-1","#cite_note-nap-3","/wiki/Annual_Review_of_Genetics","#cite_note-nap-3","/wiki/Stroke","#cite_note-uw50-4","#cite_note-g-126-1","/wiki/Swedish_Medical_Center","/wiki/Seattle,_Washington","#cite_note-nyt-obit-2","/w/index.php?title=Herschel_L._Roman&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Herschel_L._Roman&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-g-126_1-0","#cite_ref-g-126_1-1","#cite_ref-g-126_1-2","#cite_ref-g-126_1-3","#cite_ref-g-126_1-4","#cite_ref-g-126_1-5","#cite_ref-g-126_1-6","#cite_ref-g-126_1-7","#cite_ref-g-126_1-8","#cite_ref-g-126_1-9","#cite_ref-g-126_1-10","#cite_ref-g-126_1-11","http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/126/1/1.pdf","/wiki/Genetics_(journal)","/wiki/Bethesda,_Maryland","/wiki/Genetics_Society_of_America","/wiki/International_Standard_Serial_Number","//www.worldcat.org/issn/0016-6731","#cite_ref-nyt-obit_2-0","#cite_ref-nyt-obit_2-1","#cite_ref-nyt-obit_2-2","http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D9153DF935A35754C0A96F948260","/wiki/The_New_York_Times","/wiki/New_York,_New_York","/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Company","#cite_ref-nap_3-0","#cite_ref-nap_3-1","#cite_ref-nap_3-2","#cite_ref-nap_3-3","#cite_ref-nap_3-4","#cite_ref-nap_3-5","#cite_ref-nap_3-6","http://www.nap.edu/readingroom.php?book=biomems&page=hroman.html","/wiki/National_Academies_Press","#cite_ref-uw50_4-0","#cite_ref-uw50_4-1","#cite_ref-uw50_4-2","#cite_ref-uw50_4-3","#cite_ref-uw50_4-4","#cite_ref-uw50_4-5","#cite_ref-uw50_4-6","#cite_ref-uw50_4-7","#cite_ref-uw50_4-8","#cite_ref-uw50_4-9","#cite_ref-uw50_4-10","http://www.gs.washington.edu/news/history/50years.html","/wiki/University_of_Washington","http://www.gs.washington.edu/news/history/50years.html","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/51751911","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herschel_L._Roman&oldid=567644586","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1914_births","/wiki/Category:1989_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_M%C5%82awa_County","/wiki/Category:Deaths_from_stroke","/wiki/Category:American_geneticists","/w
