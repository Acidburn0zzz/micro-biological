{"cursor":"7252","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Jeffrey Barry Harborne' FRS (Bristol, 1 September 1928 -\n21 July 2002) was a British chemist who specialised in phytochemistry. He was\nProfessor of Botany at the University of Reading, 1976â93, then Professor\nemeritus. He contributed to more than 40 books and 270 research papers and was a\npioneer in ecological biochemistry, particularly in the complex chemical\ninteractions between plants, microbes and insects.\n\nHe studied at the University of Bristol, where he graduated in chemistry in\n1949. He earned a Ph.D. in 1953 with a thesis on the naturally occurring oxygen\nheterocyclic compounds with Professor Wilson Baker (1900â2002). Between 1953 and\n1955 he worked as a postdoc with Professor Theodore Albert Geissman in the\nphenolic plant pigments, including anthocyanins. The identification of these\nsubstances, he made use of UV / VIS spectroscopy.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1968 Harborne worked as a research assistant at the University\nof Liverpool. After this, he worked with [http://www.reading.ac.uk/biologicalsciences/about/staff/v-h-\nheywood.aspx Vernon Heywood] at the University of Reading. Harborne was\nassociate professor and research assistant in the Department of Botany. In 1976\nhe became professor. Between 1987 and 1993 he was head of the [http://www.reading.ac.uk/biologicalsciences/museums-facilities/biosci-\nharrisgarden.aspx Department of Botany]. In 1993 he retired. He had in his\ntenure at the [http://www.herbarium.reading.ac.uk/index.php University of\nReading] also positions as visiting professor at the University Federal do Rio\nde Janeiro (1973), the University of Texas at Austin (1976), the University of\nCalifornia at Santa Barbara (1977) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-\nChampaign (1981).\n\nHarborne investigated the role of flavonoids in interactions between plants and\ninsects. He also investigated the relationship between anthocyanins\nand the ecology of pollination. He also studied the role of phytoalexins in\nmembers of the Fabaceae family (Leguminosae), the rose family (Rosaceae) and the\ndisplay of flowers family (Umbelliferae). He has published on chemotaxonomy as\nin his research articles on the prevention of anthocyanins, flavones and auron\nin the primrose family (Primulaceae) in snapdragons (Antirrhinum) and a number\nof other plants. He also published on isoflavones and chemical ecology.\n\nIn his book, [http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0412572702 Phytochemicals Methods: A\nGuide to Modern Techniques of Plant Analysis] Prof. Harborne described a number\nof analytical methods in plant chemistry that he developed for the system of\ndistribution of anthocyanins in major plant groups. In Comparative Biochemistry\nof the Flavonoids he described the biochemistry of flavonoids in various plant\ngroups. In the scientific journal Natural Product Reports he wrote a series of\nreview articles about the discovery of anthocyanins and other flavonoids. In his\nbook Introduction to Ecological Biochemistry he described the ecological role of\nnatural substances. The publication of this book is seen as the starting point\nof the study of environmental chemistry. Developments in the chemical ecology he\ndescribed in a series of review articles in Natural Product Reports. He was (co)\nauthor of about 270 research and review articles. He was also author or editor\nof some forty books. From 1972 Prof. Harborne was the Executive Editor of the\njournal Phytochemistry. Between 1986 and 1999 he was chief editor of this\nprestigious journal. He was the founder of the magazine Analysis Phytochemicals\nand he was editor of Methods in Plant Biochemistry. Harborne had a number of\nawards during his lifetime. In 1985 he received the [http://www.linnean-\nonline.org/ Linnean Society of London], the Linnean Medal for his services to\nbotany. He also received medals from the Phytochemical Society of Europe (PSE\nMedal) (1986) and the [http://www.springerlink.com/content/lr47505572613158/\nInternational Society of Chemical Ecology] (1993). In 1993 he was awarded the\nPergamon Phytochemistry Prize. In 1995 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal\nSociety. In 2010 the University of Reading's Plant Science Laboratories, where\nhe was Professor, were named the [http://www.reading.ac.uk/biologicalsciences/contact/biosci-\ncontact.aspx Harborne Building] in his honor.\n\nHis niece, Katharine Harborne, studied Horticultural Botany at the University of\nReading from 1979â1981 and became a plant pathologist researching the
