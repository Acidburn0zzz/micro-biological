{"cursor":"4983","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Josef Hyrtl' (7 December 1810 – 17 July 1894) was an Austrian anatomist.\n\nHyrtl was born at Kismarton, (now Eisenstadt) in Hungary. He began his medical\nstudies in Vienna in 1831, having received his preliminary education in his\nnative town. His parents were poor, and he had to find some means to help defray\nthe expenses of his medical education. In 1833, while he was still a medical\nstudent, he was named prosector in anatomy, and the preparations which this\nposition required him to make for teaching purposes attracted the attention of\nprofessors as well as students. His graduation thesis, Antiquitates anatomicÃ¦\nrariores, was a prophecy of the work to which his life was to be devoted. On\ngraduation he became Prof. Czermak's assistant (famulus) and later became also\nthe curator of the museum. He added valuable treasures to the museum by the\npreparations which he made for it. As a student he set up a little laboratory\nand dissecting room in his lodgings, and his injections of anatomical material\nwere greatly admired. He took advantage of his post in the museum to give\nspecial courses in anatomy to students and in practical anatomy to physicians.\nThese courses were numerously attended.\n\nIn 1837, when only twenty-six, Hyrtl was offered the professorship of anatomy at\nthe University of Prague, and by his work there laid the foundation of his great\nreputation as a teacher of anatomy. There he completed his well known textbook\nof human anatomy, which went through some twenty editions and has been\ntranslated into several languages. The chair of anatomy at Vienna fell vacant in\n1845. Satisfied with the opportunities for work at Prague, he would not have\napplied for the post but for the insistence of his friends. He was immediately\nelected. Five years later he published his Handbook of Topographic Anatomy, the\nfirst textbook of applied anatomy of its kind ever issued. Before his death he\nwas to see this department of anatomy become one of the most important portions\nof the teaching in the medical schools of the world. It was as a teacher that\nHyrtl did his great work. Professor Karl von Bardeleben, himself one of the\ngreat teachers of the nineteenth century, did not hesitate to say that in this\nHyrtl was unequalled. His fame spread throughout Europe, and he came to be\nlooked upon as the special glory of the University of Vienna. In 1865, on the\noccasion of the celebration of the five-hundredth anniversary of the foundation\nof the university, he was chosen rector in order that, as the most distinguished\nmember of the university, he should represent her on that day. His inaugural\naddress as rector had for its subject The Materialistic Conception of The\nUniverse of Our Time. In this he argued that there was clear lack of logic in\nthe materialistic view of the world and concluded: \"When I bring all this\ntogether it is impossible for me to understand on what scientific grounds is\nfounded this resurrection of the old materialistic view of the world that had\nits first great expression from Epicurus and Lucretius. Nothing that I can see\njustifies it, and there is no reason to think that it will continue to hold\ndomination over men's minds.\"\n\nIn 1880 there was a magnificent celebration of Hyrtl's seventieth birthday, when\nmessages of congratulation were sent to him from all the universities of the\nworld. After retiring from his professorship he continued to do good work, his\nlast publication being on Arabic and Hebraic elements in anatomy. On the morning\nof 17 July 1894, he was found dead in bed at his estate near Vienna.\n\nHis monograph for the reform of anatomical terminology Onomatologia Anatomica\n(Vienna, 1880), attracted widespread attention.\n","linknr":149,"url":"Josef_Hyrtl","recorded":1376425392,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Josef_Hyrtl&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Josef_Hyrtl&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Hyrtl","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Translation_to_english_arrow.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Translation_to_english_arrow.svg/50px-Translation_to_english_arrow.svg.png","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Hyrtl","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/","http://translate.google.com/translate?&u=http%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJosef+Hyrtl&sl=de&tl=en","/wiki/Talk:Josef_Hyrtl","/wiki/Wikipedia:Copying_within_Wikipedia","/wiki/Wikipedia:Translation","/wiki/File:Joseph_Hyrtl.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Joseph_Hyrtl.jpg/170px-Joseph_Hyrtl.jpg","/wiki/File:Joseph_Hyrtl.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Austria","/wiki/Anatomist","/wiki/Kismarton","/wiki/Eisenstadt","/wiki/Hungary","/wiki/Vienna","/wiki/Prosector","/wiki/Anatomy","/wiki/Laboratory","/wiki/Dissecting","/wiki/Charles_University_in_Prague","/wiki/Textbook","/wiki/Karl_von_Bardeleben","/wiki/University_of_Vienna","/wiki/Materialism","/wiki/World_view","/wiki/Science","/wiki/Epicurus","/wiki/Lucretius","/wiki/Arabic_language","/wiki/Hebraic","/w/index.php?title=Josef_Hyrtl&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Josef_Hyrtl&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:PD-icon.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia","/wiki/Hyrtl","/wiki/File:Translation_to_english_arrow.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Translation_to_english_arrow.svg/50px-Translation_to_english_arrow.svg.png","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Hyrtl","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/","http://translate.google.com/translate?&u=http%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJosef+Hyrtl&sl=de&tl=en","/wiki/Talk:Josef_Hyrtl","/wiki/Wikipedia:Copying_within_Wikipedia","/wiki/Wikipedia:Translation","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/64116625","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Josef_Hyrtl&oldid=540525392","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1810_births","/wiki/Category:1894_deaths","/wiki/Category:19th-century_Hungarian_people","/wiki/Category:19th-century_Austrian_people","/wiki/Category:Hungarian_anatomists","/wiki/Category:Hungarian_scientists","/wiki/Category:Hungarian_biologists","/wiki/Category:Austrian_anatomists","/wiki/Category:Austrian_biologists","/wiki/Category:Austrian_people_of_Hungarian_descent","/wiki/Category:People_from_Eisenstadt","/wiki/Category:Articles_to_be_expanded_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_to_be_expanded","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_translation_from_German_Wikipedia","/wiki/Category:Articles_incorporating_text_from_the_1913_Catholic_Encyclopedia_with_no_article_parameter","/wiki/Category:Articles_to_be_expanded_from_June_2010","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Josef+Hyrtl&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Josef+Hyrtl","/wiki/Josef_Hyrtl","/wiki/Talk:Josef_Hyrtl","#","/wiki/Josef_Hyrtl","/w/index.php?title=Josef_Hyrtl&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Josef_Hyrtl&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Josef_Hyrtl&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Commun
