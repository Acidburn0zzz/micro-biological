{"cursor":"2946","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'StÃ©phane Leduc' (1 November 1853 â 8 March 1939) was a French biologist who\nsought to contribute to understanding of the chemical and physical mechanisms of\nlife. He was a scientist in the fledgling field of\nsynthetic biology, particularly in relation to diffusion and osmosis. He was a\nprofessor at the Ãcole de MÃ©decine de Nantes and worked on osmotic\ncrystallisation and the physiological effects of electric current. He was an\nOfficier de la LÃ©gion d'honneur.\n\nLeduc believed that it is necessary to appreciate biological processes from a\nphysical perspective and constructed models from physics and chemistry to try to\nexplain development and growth; these would typically involve ingenious\ncombinations of chemicals to produce systems which mimicked the appearance of\nliving processes such as karyokinesis and \"remarkable fungus-like forms\". He \"[repudiated] extra-physical forces in the phenomena of\nlife\". According to Keller, these models were largely\nunsuccessful, \"not just because of the conspicuous artificiality of his osmotic\ngrowths\". Leduc sought to synthesise life \"by directing the\nphysical forces which are its cause\" (in his own words).\n","linknr":-1,"url":"StÃ©phane_Leduc","recorded":1376428643,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["French biologists","French chemists","1939 deaths","1853 births"],"headings":["Publications","Further reading","References"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biologist","Chemical","Physics","Synthetic_biology","Diffusion","Osmosis","Professor","École_de_Médecine_de_Nantes","Osmotic_crystallisation","Physiology","Electric_current","Officier_de_la_Légion_d'honneur","Physics","Developmental_biology","Karyokinesis"]}
