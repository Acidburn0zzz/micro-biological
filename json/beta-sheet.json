{"cursor":"22680","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Î² sheet' (also 'Î²-pleated sheet') is the second form of regular secondary\nstructure in proteins, only somewhat less common than the alpha helix. Beta\nsheets consist of 'beta strands' connected laterally by at least two or three\nbackbone hydrogen bonds, forming a generally twisted, pleated sheet. A beta\nstrand (also 'Î² strand') is a stretch of polypeptide chain typically 3 to 10\namino acids long with backbone in an almost fully extended conformation. The higher-\nlevel association of Î² sheets has been implicated in formation of the protein\naggregates and fibrils observed in many human diseases, notably the amyloidoses\nsuch as Alzheimer's disease. Î² sheet fragment from a crystal structure of the\nenzyme catalase (PDB file 1GWE at 0.88Ã resolution). a) Front view, showing the\nantiparallel hydrogen bonds (dotted) between peptide NH and CO groups on\nadjacent strands. Arrows indicate chain direction, and electron density contours\noutline the non-H atoms. O atoms are red balls, N atoms are blue, and H atoms\nare omitted for simplicity; sidechains are shown only out to the first sidechain\nC atom (green). b) Edge-on view of the central two Î² strands in a, showing the\nrighthanded twist and the pleat of CÎ±s and sidechains that alternately stick out\nin opposite directions from the sheet.]]\n","linknr":-1,"url":"beta-sheet","recorded":1376427653,"links":[],"instances":["chemistry","biochemistry","art","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein structural motifs"],"headings":["History","Structure and orientation","Common structural motifs","Structural architectures of proteins with beta-sheets","Structural topology","Dynamic features","Parallel β helices","β sheets in pathology","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["chirality","chemistry"],["turn","biochemistry"],["meander","art"],["folding","chemistry"]],"members":["folding","turn","meander","chirality"],"related":["Secondary_structure","Protein","Alpha_helix","Hydrogen_bond","Beta_strand","Peptide","Amino_acid","Amyloidosis","Alzheimer's_disease","Catalase","William_Astbury","Peptide_bond","Peptide_bond","Linus_Pauling","Robert_Corey","Oxygen","Nitrogen","Oxygen","Nitrogen","Hydrogen_bond","Amine","Hydrogen_bond","Carbonyl","Ångström","Cis-trans_isomerism","Peptide_bond","Virtual_bond","Hydrogen_bond","Chirality_(chemistry)","Dihedral_angle","Ramachandran_plot","Dihedral_angle","BPTI","N-terminal_end","C-terminal_end","Hydrogen_bond","Hydrogen_bond","Peptide_bond","Hydrogen_bond","Hydrogen_bond","Beta_bulge","Peptide_bond","Carbonyl","Alpha_helix","Amyloid","Structural_motif","Beta_hairpin","Glycine","Proline","Turn_(biochemistry)","Alpha_helix","Protein_folding","Meander_(art)","Beta-alpha-beta","Tertiary_structure","TIM_barrel","Monoclonal_antibodies","Structural_motif","Beta_hairpin","Beta_barrel","Beta_propeller","Aspartic_acid_protease","All-β_proteins","Α+β_proteins","Α/β_proteins","Peptide","All-β_proteins","Beta_barrel","Beta_sandwich","Beta_prism","Beta-propeller_domain","Beta_helix","Hydrogen_bond","Flavodoxin_fold","Secondary_structure","Hydrogen_bond","Flavodoxin_fold","Immunoglobulin_fold","TIM_barrel","Beta-barrel","SH3_domain","Ribonuclease_inhibitor","Beta-propeller_domain","Immunoglobulin_fold","Low-frequency_collective_motion_in_proteins_and_DNA","Raman_spectroscopy","Beta_helix","Beta_helix","Triangular_prism","LpxA","Pectate_lyase","P22_phage","Metalloprotease","Amyloid_plaque","Alzheimer's_disease","Folding_(chemistry)","Tertiary_structure","Alpha_helix","Collagen_helix","Foldamers"]}
