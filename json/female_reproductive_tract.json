These parts are internal;\nthe vagina meets the external organs at the vulva, which includes the labia,\nclitoris and urethra. The vagina is attached to the uterus through the cervix,\nwhile the uterus is attached to the ovaries via the Fallopian tubes. At certain\nintervals, the ovaries release an ovum, which passes through the Fallopian tube\ninto the uterus. If, in this transit, it meets with sperm, the sperm penetrate\nand merge with the egg, fertilizing it.\n\nDuring the reproductive process, the egg releases certain molecules that are\nessential to guiding the sperm and these allow the surface of the egg to attach\nto the sperm's surface then the egg can absorb the sperm and fertilization\nbegins. The fertilization usually occurs in the oviducts, but can\nhappen in the uterus itself. The zygote then implants itself in the wall of the\nuterus, where it begins the processes of embryogenesis and morphogenesis. When\ndeveloped enough to survive outside the womb, the cervix dilates and\ncontractions of the uterus propel the fetus through the birth canal, which is\nthe vagina.\n\nThe ova are larger than sperm and have formed by the time a female is born.\nApproximately every month, a process of oogenesis matures one ovum to be sent\ndown the Fallopian tube attached to its ovary in anticipation of fertilization.\nIf not fertilized, this egg is flushed out of the system through menstruation.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"female_reproductive_tract","recorded":1376428437,"links":[],"instances":["geometry","medicine","geometry","anatomy","anatomy","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Human female reproductive system|"],"headings":["Embryonic development","Internal","External","Female genital modification","Ancient Greek thought","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["cylinder","geometry"],["cone","geometry"],["organ","anatomy"],["egg","biology"],["lumen","anatomy"],["sterilization","medicine"]],"members":["cylinder","sterilization","cone","organ","lumen","egg"],"related":["Uterus","Vagina","Sperm","Ovary","Vulva","Labia","Clitoris","Urethra","Cervix","Fallopian_tube","Ovum","Fertilisation","Oviduct","Zygote","Embryogenesis","Morphogenesis","Womb","Fetus","Oogenesis","Menstruation","Fertilisation","Chromosome","Testosterone","Clitoris","Vagina","Cylinder_(geometry)","Uterus","Female_mammal","Cloaca","Bird","Reptile","Insect","Invertebrate","Oviduct","Semen","Sexual_intercourse","Ejaculation","Cylindrical","Cone_(geometry)","Uterus","Organ_(anatomy)","Muscle","Endometrium","Embryo","Fetus","Childbirth","Menstruation","Oviduct","Cilia","Endometrium","Pregnancy","Egg_(biology)","Ovulation","Frequency","Menstrual_cycle","Cilia","Lumen_(anatomy)","Distal_ostia_of_the_Fallopian_tubes","Abdominal_cavity","Menstruation","Transluminal_procedure","Fertiloscopy","Intrauterine_insemination","Sterilization_(medicine)","Mons_pubis","Pudendal_cleft","Labia_majora","Labia_minora","Bartholin's_glands","Clitoris","Clitoral_hood","Cosmetic_surgery","Steroids","World_Health_Organization","Female_genital_mutilation","Bleeding","Tetanus","Sepsis","Urine_retention","Childbirth","Infertility","Africa","Asia","Middle_East","North_America","Europe","Hippocrates","Galen","Human_fertilization","Development_of_the_reproductive_system","Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction","Female_infertility","Male_reproductive_system","Oogenesis","Reproduction","Reproductive_system"]}
