{"cursor":"17132","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Conservation is the maintenance of biological diversity. Conservation can focus\non preserving diversity at genetic, species, community or whole ecosystem\nlevels. This article will examine conservation at the species level, because\nmutualisms involve interactions between species. The ultimate goal of\nconservation at this level is to prevent the extinction of species. However,\nspecies conservation has the broader aim of maintaining the abundance and\ndistribution of all species, not only those threatened with extinction (van Dyke\n2008). Determining the value of conserving particular species can be done\nthrough the use of evolutionary significant units, which essentially attempt to\nprioritise the conservation of the species which are rarest, fastest declining,\nand most distinct genotypically and phenotypically (Moritz 1994, Fraser and\nBernatchez 2001).\n\nMutualisms can be defined as âinterspecific interactions in which each of two\npartner species receives a net benefitâ (Bronstein et al. 2004). Here net\nbenefit is defined as, a short-term increase in inclusive fitness (IF).\nIncorporating the concept of genetic relatedness (through IF) is essential\nbecause many mutualisms involve the eusocial insects, where the majority of\nindividuals are not reproductively active. The short-term component is chosen\nbecause it is operationally useful, even though the role of long-term\nadaptation is not considered (de Mazancourt et al. 2005). This definition of\nmutualism should be suffice for this article, although it neglects discussion\nof the many subtitles of IF theory applied to mutualisms, and the difficulties\nof examining short-term compared to long-term benefits, which are discussed in\nFoster and Wenselneers (2006) and de Mazancourt et al. (2005) respectively.\nMutualisms can be broadly divided into two categories. Firstly, obligate\nmutualism, where two mutualistic partners are completely interdependent for\nsurvival and reproduction. Secondly, facultative mutualism, where two\nmutualistic partners both benefit from the mutualism, but can theoretically\nsurvive in each othersâ absence.\n\nMutualisms are remarkably common, in fact all organisms are believed to be\ninvolved in a mutualism at some point during their lives (Bronstein et al.\n2004). This is particularly likely to be true for the definition of mutualism\nadopted here, where herbivory can paradoxically be mutualistic, for example in a\nsituation where a plant overcompensates by producing more biomass when grazed\non. Therefore, any species identified as particularly important to conserve will\nprobably have mutualistic partners. It is beyond the purview of this article to\ndiscuss all these mutualisms, so the focus will be on specifically animal-plant\nmutualisms.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Mutualisms_and_Conservation","recorded":1376426953,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualisms_and_conservation","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_Conservation&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Conservation_(ethic)","/wiki/Biological_diversity","/wiki/Genetics","/wiki/Species","/wiki/Community","/wiki/Ecosystem","/wiki/Mutualisms","/wiki/Extinction","#Mutualism_coextinction","#Mutualism_.22codeclines.22","#Alien_species_in_mutualisms","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Maculinea_arion","/w/index.php?title=Myrmica_sableti&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Myxoma","/wiki/Oligolectic","/wiki/Fig_wasps","/wiki/Fig_tree","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/Indian_Rubber_Tree","/w/index.php?title=Pleistodontes_clavigar&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation","/wiki/Podarcis_lilfordi","/w/index.php?title=Daphne_rodriguezii&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/White-eye","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&veaction=edit&section=3","/wiki/Hawaiian_Islands","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&veaction=edit&section=4","/wiki/Conservation_biology","/wiki/Mutualism_(biology)","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&veaction=edit&section=5","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&oldid=433168261","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Conservation_biology","/wiki/Category:Mutualism_(biology)","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mutualisms+and+conservation&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mutualisms+and+conservation","/wiki/Mutualisms_and_conservation","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mutualisms_and_conservation&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Mutualisms_and_conservation","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Mutualisms_and_conservation","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Mutualisms_and_conservation","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&oldid=433168261","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Mutualisms_and_conservation&id=433168261","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Mutualisms+and+conservation","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Mutualisms+and+conservation&oldid=433168261&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Mutualisms_and_conservation&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_
