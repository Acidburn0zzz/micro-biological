Proposed methods of vas-occlusive\ncontraception attempt to prevent sperm from traveling down the vasa deferentia.\nPotential methods include , s, valves, and other devices.\n\nThe 'intra vas device' ('IVD'), analogous to the intrauterine device (IUD) for\nwomen, is meant to be a reversible alternative to a vasectomy. The device\nconsists of a set of flexible, hollow silicone plugs, each about a millimetre in\ndiameter and 2.5 cm long. The IVDs are inserted into the vas deferens and block\nthe flow of sperm from the testes to the seminal vesicles.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Vas-occlusive_contraception","recorded":1376428445,"links":[],"instances":["united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Experimental methods of birth control","Contraception for males","Andrology"],"headings":["Progress","Side effects","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["food_and_drug_administration","united_states"]],"members":["food_and_drug_administration"],"related":["Experiment","Male_contraceptive","Spermatozoon","Vasa_deferentia","Valve","Intrauterine_device","Vasectomy","Silicone","Vas_deferens","Testes","Seminal_vesicle","Clinical_trial","Shepherd_Medical","Vancouver","China","Elastomer","Polyurethane","Silicone_rubber","Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)","Antibody","Male_contraceptive"]}
