It is found in all animals with a circulatory\nsystem, which includes the vertebrates.\n\nThe adjective 'cardiac' means \"related to the heart\" and comes from the Greek\nÎºÎ±ÏÎ´Î¹Î¬, kardia, for \"heart\". Cardiology is the medical speciality that deals\nwith cardiac diseases and abnormalities.\n\nThe vertebrate heart is principally composed of cardiac muscle and connective\ntissue. Cardiac muscle is an involuntary striated muscle tissue specific to the\nheart and is responsible for the ability of the heart to pump blood.\n\nThe average human heart, beating at 72 beats per minute, will beat approximately\n2.5 billion times during an average 66 year lifespan. It weighs approximately in\nfemales and in males.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"cardiac","recorded":1376429393,"links":[],"instances":["physiology","medicine","biology","heart","heart"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Heart|","Cardiology","Organs","Circulatory system"],"headings":["Structure","The invertebrate heart","Functioning","Early development","History of discoveries","Additional Images","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["specialty","medicine"],["atrium","heart"],["ventricle","heart"],["respiration","physiology"],["homology","biology"]],"members":["respiration","specialty","homology","ventricle","atrium"],"related":["Stethoscope","Ogg","Muscle","Blood","Blood_vessel","Animal","Circulatory_system","Vertebrate","Greek_language","Cardiology","Specialty_(medicine)","Cardiovascular_disease","Cardiac_muscle","Connective_tissue","Human_heart","Cardiac_cycle_","Animal","Circulatory_system","Cephalopod","Pericardium","Peritoneum","Hagfish","Pericardium","Fibrous_pericardium","Epicardium","Myocardium","Endocardium","Endothelium","Cardiac_cycle","Venae_cavae","Tricuspid_valve","Right_ventricle","Pulmonary_valve","Pulmonary_artery","Lung","Pulmonary_vein","Left_atrium","Mitral_valve","Left_ventricle","Aortic_valve","Aorta","Sinus_venosus","Hepatic_vein","Cardinal_vein","Atrium_(heart)","Ventricle_(heart)","Conus_arteriosus","Descending_aorta","Tetrapod","Ascending_aorta","Pulmonary_artery","Cartilaginous_fish","Ray-finned_fish","Teleost","Amniote","Amphibian","Reptile","Double_circulatory_system","Lung","Septum","Venae_cavae","Pulmonary_vein","Lungfish","Tetrapod","Invertebrate","Protein","Fat","Sugar","Insect","Respiration_(physiology)","Arthropod","Spider","Crustacean","Crab","Shrimp","Hemolymph","Copper","Hemocyanin","Iron","Hemoglobin","Red_blood_cell","Vertebrate","Midsternal_line","Sternocostal_articulation","Human_sternum","Archosaur","Crocodilia","Bird","Mammal","Heart_chamber","Foramen_of_Panizza","Thorax","Dextrocardia","Human_sternum","Left_heart","Lung","Coronary_circulation","Pericardium","Lung","Dense_connective_tissue","Serous_fluid","Mediastinum","Lung","Stethoscope","Hypertrophy","Right_heart","Right_atrium","Right_ventricle","Pulmonary_circulation","Gas_exchange","Diffusion","Left_heart","Lung","Left_atrium","Left_ventricle","Systemic_circulation","Tricuspid_valve","Semilunar_valve","Artery","Vein","Mitral_valve","Aorta","Syncytium","Purkinje_fibers","Electrocardiography","Blood_pressure","Heart_sounds","Cardiac_cycle","Amniote","Homology_(biology)","Codfish","Hummingbird","Tachycardia","Asystole","Cardiac_tamponade","Pericardiocentesis","Pericardial_sac","Human_sternum","Mammalian","Mesoderm","Gastrulation","Mesothelium","Endothelium","Myocardium","Pericardium","Splanchnopleuric","Cardiogenic_plates","Neural_plate","Embryon","Menstrual_cycle","Hippocrates","Philosophers","Erasistratos","Capillary","Galen","Liver","Chyle","Cardiac_surgery","Electrical_conduction_system_of_the_heart","Heart_disease","Langendorff_heart","Cardiovascular_physiology","Trauma_triad_of_death","Cardiophobia"]}
