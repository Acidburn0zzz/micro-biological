PE most commonly results from deep vein\nthrombosis (a blood clot in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis) that breaks\noff and migrates to the lung, a process termed [[venous thromboembolism]] (VTE).\nA small proportion of cases are due to the embolization of air, fat, or talc in\ndrugs of intravenous drug abusers or amniotic fluid. The obstruction of the\nblood flow through the lungs and the resultant pressure on the right ventricle\nof the heart lead to the symptoms and signs of PE. The risk of PE is increased\nin various situations, such as cancer or prolonged bed rest.\n\nSymptoms of pulmonary embolism include difficulty breathing, chest pain on\ninspiration, and palpitations. Clinical signs include low blood oxygen\nsaturation and cyanosis, rapid breathing, and a rapid heart rate. Severe cases\nof PE can lead to collapse, abnormally low blood pressure, and sudden death.\n\nDiagnosis is based on these clinical findings in combination with laboratory\ntests (such as the D-dimer test) and imaging studies, usually CT pulmonary\nangiography. Treatment is typically with anticoagulant medication, including\nheparin and warfarin. Severe cases may require thrombolysis with drugs such as\ntissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or may require surgical intervention via\npulmonary thrombectomy.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"pulmonary_embolism","recorded":1376428641,"links":[],"instances":["circulatory","tests","test","tests","anatomy","physiology","medical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical emergencies","Pulmonary heart disease and diseases of pulmonary circulation"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Risk factors","Diagnosis","Treatment","Epidemiology","Prognosis","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["collapse","medical"],["shock","circulatory"],["collapse","medical"],["shock","circulatory"],["posterior","anatomy"],["gold_standard","test"],["sensitivity","tests"],["specificity","tests"],["sensitivity","tests"],["specificity","tests"],["ventilation","physiology"],["sensitivity","tests"],["oxygenation","medical#oxygen_saturation"]],"members":["shock","specificity","gold_standard","sensitivity","posterior","ventilation","oxygenation","collapse"],"related":["CT_scan","Radiocontrast","Pulmonary_artery","Pulmonary_artery","Embolism","Deep_vein_thrombosis","Air_embolism","Fat_embolism","Amniotic_fluid_embolism","Lung","Right_ventricle","Cancer","Bed_rest","Dyspnea","Pleuritic_chest_pain","Palpitation","Clinical_sign","Oxygen_saturation","Cyanosis","Tachypnea","Tachycardia","Collapse_(medical)","Shock_(circulatory)","Cardiac_arrest","D-dimer","CT_pulmonary_angiography","Anticoagulant","Heparin","Warfarin","Thrombolysis","Tissue_plasminogen_activator","Pulmonary_thrombectomy","Dyspnea","Tachypnea","Chest_pain","Cough","Hemoptysis","Cyanosis","Collapse_(medical)","Shock_(circulatory)","Sudden_cardiac_death","Pleural_friction_rub","Pleural_effusion","Heart_sounds","Jugular_venous_pressure","Fever","Jaundice","Ascites","Deep_venous_thrombosis","Virchow's_triad","Physical_trauma","Pregnancy","Obesity","Cancer","Estrogen","Hormonal_contraception","Factor_V_Leiden","Prothrombin_mutation_G20210A","Protein_C_deficiency","Protein_S_deficiency","Antithrombin","Hyperhomocysteinemia","Plasminogen","Fibrinolysis","Antiphospholipid_syndrome","Nephrotic_syndrome","Paroxysmal_nocturnal_hemoglobinuria","Cancer","Shortness_of_breath","Chest_pain","Medical_history","Physical_examination","Clinical_prediction_rule","Geneva_score","DVT","Tachycardia","DVT","Hemoptysis","D-dimer","D-dimer","Blood_test","Blood_test","Full_blood_count","Coagulation","Prothrombin_time","APTT","Thrombin_time","Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate","Renal_function","Liver_enzyme","Electrolyte","Saddle_embolus","Hormonal_contraceptives","Valdecoxib","Xenon","Posterior_(anatomy)","Technetium","Albumin","D-dimer","Gold_standard_(test)","Pulmonary_angiography","CT_pulmonary_angiogram","Pulmonary_angiogram","Computed_tomography","Radiocontrast","Differential_diagnosis","Cohort_study","Spiral_CT","Sensitivity_(tests)","Specificity_(tests)","Positive_predictive_value","Negative_predictive_value","Sensitivity_(tests)","Specificity_(tests)","Ventilation/perfusion_scan","Scintigraphy","Ventilation_(physiology)","Perfusion","Iodinated_contrast","Pregnancy","Sensitivity_(tests)","Chest_X-ray","Congestive_heart_failure","Rib_fracture","Radiologic_sign","Westermark_sign","Hampton's_hump","Medical_ultrasound","Deep_venous_thrombosis","Ultrasonography","Pregnancy","Right_bundle_branch_block","Electrocardiogram","Myocardial_infarction","Cor_pulmonale","T_wave","Sinus_tachycardia","Right_bundle_branch_block","Echocardiography","Pulmonary_artery","Right_ventricle","Thrombolysis","Troponin","Brain_natriuretic_peptide","Medical_algorithm","Anticoagulant_therapy","Oxygen_therapy","Analgesia","Heparin","Low_molecular_weight_heparin","Fondaparinux","Warfarin","Acenocoumarol","Phenprocoumon","Systematic_review","Randomized_controlled_trial","Cochrane_Collaboration","Relative_risk_reduction","Absolute_risk_reduction","Number_needed_to_treat","International_normalized_ratio","Teratogenic","D-dimer","Thrombolysis","Cerebrovascular_accident","Echocardiography","Contraindication","Inferior_vena_cava_filter","Pulmonary_thrombectomy","Pulmonary_hypertension","Pulmonary_thromboendarterectomy","Mortality_rate","Bristol_Royal_Infirmary","Pulmonary_hypertension","Fibrinolysis","Anticoagulant","Factor_V_Leiden_mutation","Protein_C","Protein_S","Antithrombin","Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase","Factor_VIII","Coagulation"]}
