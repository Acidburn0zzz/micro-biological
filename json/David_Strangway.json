He is President\nEmeritus of the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia.\n\nStrangway studied at the University of Toronto, earning a B.A. in Physics and\nGeology in 1956, an M.A. in physics and a Ph.D in physics in 1960. Strangway\nbegan his teaching career as an Assistant Professor of Geology at the University\nof Colorado between 1961-64. In 1965, he joined M.I.T for three years as both an\nAssistant Professor of Geophysics and Researcher. In 1970, he joined NASA as the\nChief of the Geophysics Branch and was responsible for the geophysical aspects\nof the Apollo missions. In 1972, he was awarded the NASA Exceptional Scientific\nAchievement Medal for his scientific contribution to\nNASA. [http://nasapeople.nasa.gov/awards/nasamedals.htm NASA Agency Honor\nAwards] As Chief of NASA's Geophysics Branch, David Strangway designed\nlunar experiments for Apollo astronauts and also was involved in the examination\nof returned moon rocks that contributed to the further knowledge of the solar\nsystem. Strangway is the author or co-author of more than 165 research papers,\nincluding results of lunar sample studies and experiments. Strangway's research\nfocused extensively on magnetic studies and electromagnetic sounding, both\nterrestrially for exploration and mapping and in lunar mapping and exploration.\nSince 1971 he has served on a great number of scientific and academic committees\non behalf of governmental or private sector organizations.\n\nHe was a vice-president at the University of Toronto and the chairman of its\nGeology Department from 1973 to 1983. Upon the retirement of James Ham in 1983,\nStrangway was appointed the acting president of the University of Toronto. He\nwas elevated to become the University's eleventh President after the designated\nsuccessor, Donald Forster, suddenly died of a heart attack in August of that\nyear. [http://www.magazine.utoronto.ca/00summer/presidents.asp U of T\nMagazine: The Cast of Presidents]\n\nFrom 1985 to 1997, he was the tenth President of the University of British\nColumbia. He provided the direction and impetus that enabled the large, publicly\nfunded University of British Columbia to achieve world-class status during his\n12 years as President. This was enhanced by leading what was at the time,\nCanada's largest fund-raising campaign and by creating UBC Real Estate Corp. to\ndevelop market housing.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2004, he was the President and Chief Executive Officer of the\nCanada Foundation for Innovation, an independent corporation created by the\nGovernment of Canada to fund research infrastructure. This autonomous, Ottawa-\nbased organization was founded in 1997 to fund and revitalize national research\ninfrastructure programs that would enable Canadian Universities, Colleges and\nResearch Hospitals to carry out across-the-board scientific and technological\nprojects of benefit to all Canadians. Of CFI's capital investment budget of\n$3.65 billion, more than $2.7 billion was invested during David's six-year\ntenure â effectively stemming the loss of Canadian researchers to other\ncountries. It was during this time that he played a key role in helping the\nCanadian government to create the Canada Research Chairs. This program, funded\nat the level of $300m a year, has created 2000 new positions in Canadian\nUniversities. Strangway retired from CFI March 31, 2004 in order to devote his\nfull attention to Quest University Canada during the important construction and\nstart-up phases of its development.\n\nIn 1997, he was appointed by the Canadian Prime Minister to join with William\nRuckelshaus, an appointee of the President of the U.S., to study the bitter\nPacific Salmon controversy between the two countries. Their work and\nrecommendations formed the basis for negotiation of a new agreement.\n\nPremier's Advisory Council on Science and Technology\n\nInternational Institute os Sustainable Development
