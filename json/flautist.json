{"cursor":"6073","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'flautist' or 'flutist' or 'flute player' is a musician who plays any\ninstrument in the flute family.\n\nThe choice of \"flautist\" (from the Italian flautista, from flauto, and adopted\ndue to eighteenth century Italian influence) versus \"flutist\" is a source of\ndispute among players of the instrument. \"Flutist\" is the earlier term in the\nEnglish language, dating from at least 1603 (the earliest quote cited by the\n[[Oxford English Dictionary]]), while \"flautist\" is not recorded before 1860,\nwhen it was used by Nathaniel Hawthorne in [[The Marble Faun]]. While the print\nversion of the OED does not indicate any regional preference for either form,\nthe online Compact OED characterizes \"flutist\" as an American usage.\n\nRichard Rockstro, in his three-volume treatise The Flute Richard Shepherd\nRockstro, The Flute (Fritz Knuf - Buren, The Netherlands, 1986[1890])\nwritten in England in 1890, uses \"flute-player.\"\n\nThe first edition of the OED lists fluter as dating from circa 1400 and Fowler's\nModern English Usage Fowler's Modern English Usage (Oxford University Press,\n1965) \"flautist, fluter, flutist\" p. 201 states that \"there seems no good\nreason\" why flautist should have prevailed over fluter or flutist. However,\naccording to Webster's Dictionary of English Usage, Webster's Dictionary of\nEnglish Usage (Merriam-Webster Inc., 1989), \"flautist, flutist\" p. 452)\nflautist is the preferred term in British English, and while both terms are used\nin American English flutist is \"by far the more common choice.\"\n\nAlso seen from around the mid seventeenth century was flutenist, but this fell\nout of use by the end of the eighteenth\ncentury. http://www.fenwicksmith.com/miscellany_flautist.html\n\nWhile the term flautist has not been found in print before 1860 there is no\ndoubt that the Italian term flautista and French term flÃ»tiste would have been\nwell known in England long before this date, considering the influence of the\nItalian and French schools of flute\nplaying. http://www.flutehistory.com/Playing/NationalStyles.php3 A\ngreat many of the commonly used musical terms in English speaking countries are\nItalian in origin, because many of the most important early composers from the\nRenaissance to the Baroque period were Italian. http://en.wikipedia.org/wik-\ni/List_of_Italian_musical_terms_used_in_English While there are many other\nwords for a flute player in European languages, flautista and similar words\nfeature prominently, so it is understandable how flautist became the preferred\nterm in British English.\n\nWords for a flute player in other European languages include: fluitspeler\n(Afrikaans), flautist (Albanian), flÃ¼tÃ§Ã¼ (Azerbaijani), flautista (Catalan),\nflautista (Croatian), flÃ©tnista (Czech), flÃ¸jtenist (Danish), fluitist (Dutch),\nflÃ¶Ã¶dimÃ¤ngija (Estonian), huilunsoittaja (Finnish), flÃ»tiste (French), FlÃ¶tist\n(German), flautist (Icelandic), fliÃºiteadÃ³ir (Gaelic), flautista (Italian),\nfleitininkas (Lithuanian), flautist (Macedonian), flÃ¸ytisten (Norwegian),\nflecista (Polish), flautista (Portuguese), flautist (Romanian), flÃ©tnista\n(Slovak), flavtistka (Slovenian), flautista (Spanish), flÃ¶jtist (Swedish),\nflÃ¼tÃ§Ã¼ (Turkish), ffliwtydd (Welsh).\n\nToday most players use the term which is dominant in their country of origin, or\nsimply call themselves flute players which has the benefit of being a neutral\nterm which arouses no animosity from those who are loyal to their own usage.\nFamous flute players have frequently entered the debate expressing their own\npersonal views:\n\nThe American player and writer Nancy Toff, in her The Flute Book, devotes more\nthan a page to the subject, commenting that she is asked \"Are you a flutist or a\nflautist?\" on a weekly basis. She prefers \"flutist\": \"Ascribe my insistence\neither to a modest lack of pretension or to etymological evidence; the result is\nthe same.\" Toff, who is also an editor for Oxford University Press, describes in\nsome detail the etymology of words for \"flute,\" comparing OED, Fowler's [[Modern\nEnglish Usage]], Evans' [[Dictionary of Contemporary American Usage]], and\nCopperud's [[American Usage and Style: The Consensus]] before arriving at her\nconclusion: \"I play the flute, not the flaut; therefore I am a flutist not a\nflautist. Nancy Toff, The Flute Book (Scribners, 1985), \"Flutist or\nFlautist?\" pp. xiv-xv\n\nEchoing the Toff quote above, James Galway summed up the way he feels about\n\"flautist,\" saying, \"I am a flute player not a flautist. I don't have a flaut\nand I've never\nflauted.\" [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,,2230184,00.html\n\"On the first day of Christmas my true love asked of me...\" Christmas quiz,\nObserver Magazine]\n\nIn the Flautist or flutist? section in his book Proper Flute Playing (ISBN 0-7119-8465-\n4 p. 56), Trevor Wye records the following conversation: \"What do you do,\nyoung man?\" \"I'm a flautist\", he replied. A long pause, then... \"What exactly is\nit that you do with floors?\" He then observes \"Perhaps we should try flutist;\nit's simpler, self-explanatory and widely understood.\"\n","linknr":126,"url":"flautist","recorded":1376424576,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Flautist&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Flautist&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flautist","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Flatulist","/wiki/Flute","/wiki/Italian_language","/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Italian_origin","/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary","/wiki/Nathaniel_Hawthorne","/wiki/The_Marble_Faun","/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Modern_English_Usage","/w/index.php?title=Dictionary_of_Contemporary_American_Usage&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=American_Usage_and_Style:_The_Consensus&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-8","/wiki/James_Galway","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0711984654","/wiki/Trevor_Wye","/w/index.php?title=Flautist&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Flautist&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_flautists","/w/index.php?title=Flautist&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Flautist&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/flutist?view=uk","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","http://www.fenwicksmith.com/miscellany_flautist.html","#cite_ref-6","http://www.flutehistory.com/Playing/NationalStyles.php3","#cite_ref-7","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Italian_musical_terms_used_in_English","#cite_ref-8","#cite_ref-9","http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,,2230184,00.html","/w/index.php?title=Flautist&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Flautist&veaction=edit&section=3","http://www.facebook.com/flutechat","http://www.mostlywind.co.uk/famflaut.html","http://www.facebook.com/flautists","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flautist&oldid=563834875","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Flautists","/wiki/Category:Occupations_in_music","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Flautist&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Flautist","/wiki/Flautist","/wiki/Talk:Flautist","#","/wiki/Flautist","/w/index.php?title=Flautist&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Flautist&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Flautist&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Flautist","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Flautist","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Flautist&oldid=563834875","/w/index.php?title=Flautist&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13625965","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Flautist&id=563834875","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Flautist","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Flautist&oldid=563834875&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Flautist&printable=yes","//da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%B8jtenist","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%BBtiste","//ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ED%94%8C%EB%A3%A8%ED%8B%B0%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%B8","//is.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flautuleikari","//la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibicina","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluitist","//sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavtist","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13625965#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediaf
