{"cursor":"3749","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Gray's Paradox' is a paradox posed in 1936 by British zoologist Sir James Gray.\nThe paradox was to figure out how dolphins can obtain such high speeds and\naccelerations with what appears to be a small muscle mass. Gray made an estimate\nof the power a dolphin could exert based on its physiology, and concluded the\npower was insufficient to overcome the drag forces in water. He hypothesized\nthat Dolphin's skin must have special anti-drag properties. Gray, J (1936)\n[http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/6/977.full.pdf+html Studies in animal\nlocomotion VI. The propulsive powers of the dolphin\"] J. Exp. Biol. '13':\n192â199.\n\nIn 2008, researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, West Chester\nUniversity and the University of California, Santa Cruz used digital particle\nimage velocimetry to prove Gray wrong.\n\nThey video taped a pair of dolphins swimming through a section of water filled\nwith hundreds of thousands of air bubbles. A computer and force measurement\ntools developed for aerospace were then used to study the particle-image\nvelocimetry which was captured at 1,000 frames per second (fps). This allowed\nthe team to measure the force exerted by a dolphin. Results showed the dolphin\nto exert approximately 200 lb of force every time it thrust its tail, (10\ntimes more than Gray hypothesized) and at peak force can exert between 300 to\n400 lb.\n\nIn 2009, researchers from the National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan\nintroduced new concepts of âkidnapped airfoilsâ and âcirculating horsepowerâ to\nexplain the swimming capabilities of the swordfish. Swordfish swim at even\nhigher speeds and accelerations than dolphins. The researchers claim their\nanalysis also \"solves the perplexity of dolphinâs Gray paradox\". Lee, Hsing-\nJuin; Jong, Yow-Jeng; Change, Li-Min; and Wu, Wen-Lin (2009)\n[http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tjsass/52/175/52_11/_article \"Propulsion\nStrategy Analysis of High-Speed Swordfish\"] Transactions of the Japan Society\nfor Aeronautical and Space Sciences, '52' (175): 11.\n\nTimothy Wei, professor and acting dean of Rensselaerâs School of Engineering,\nvideotaped two bottlenose dolphins, Primo and Puka, as they swam through a\nsection of water populated with hundreds of thousands of tiny air bubbles. He\nthen used sophisticated computer software to track the movement of the bubbles.\nThe color-coded results show the speed and in what direction the water is\nflowing around and behind the dolphin, which allowed researchers to calculate\nprecisely how much force the dolphin was producing.\n\nWei also used this technique to film dolphins as they were doing tail-stands, a\ntrick where the dolphins âwalkâ on water by holding most of their bodies\nvertical above the water while supporting themselves with short, powerful\nthrusts of their tails.\n\nThe results show that dolphins produce on average about 200 pounds of force when\nflapping their tail â about 10 times more force than Gray originally\nhypothesized.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Gray's_paradox","recorded":1376423789,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Gray%27s_paradox&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gray%27s_paradox&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray's_paradox","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Paradox","/wiki/James_Gray_(zoologist)","/wiki/Dolphin","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Rensselaer_Polytechnic_Institute","/wiki/West_Chester_University","/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz","/wiki/Particle_image_velocimetry","#cite_note-science_daily-2","#cite_note-science_daily-2","/wiki/National_Chung_Hsing_University","/wiki/Swordfish","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Gray%27s_paradox&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Gray%27s_paradox&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/6/977.full.pdf+html","#cite_ref-science_daily_2-0","#cite_ref-science_daily_2-1","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081124131334.htm","#cite_ref-3","http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tjsass/52/175/52_11/_article","/w/index.php?title=Gray%27s_paradox&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Gray%27s_paradox&veaction=edit&section=2","http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/6/977.full.pdf+html","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1242%2Fjeb.01513","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081124131334.htm","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gray%27s_paradox&oldid=560573871","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Dolphins","/wiki/Category:Zoology","/wiki/Category:Biomechanics","/wiki/Category:Paradoxes","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gray%27s+paradox&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gray%27s+paradox","/wiki/Gray%27s_paradox","/wiki/Talk:Gray%27s_paradox","#","/wiki/Gray%27s_paradox","/w/index.php?title=Gray%27s_paradox&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gray%27s_paradox&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gray%27s_paradox&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Gray%27s_paradox","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Gray%27s_paradox","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Gray%27s_paradox&oldid=560573871","/w/index.php?title=Gray%27s_paradox&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q913759","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Gray%27s_paradox&id=560573871","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Gray%27s+paradox","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Gray%27s+paradox&oldid=560573871&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Gray%27s_paradox&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%85%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%A9_%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%8A","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graysches_Paradoxon","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q913759#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray%27s_paradox","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.or
