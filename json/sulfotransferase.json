{"cursor":"2776","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" ion]] 'Sulfotransferase's are transferase enzymes that catalyze the transfer of\n a sulfo group (not a sulfate group) from a donor molecule to an acceptor\n alcohol or amine. The most common sulfo group donor is 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-\n phosphosulfate (PAPS). In the case of alcohol as acceptor, the product is a\n sulfate (R-OSO 3- ), whereas an amine leads to a sulfo-\n amine (R-NH-SO 3- ). Both reactive groups for a sulfonation\n via sulfotransferases may be part of a protein, lipid, carbohydrate or\n steroid.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"sulfotransferase","recorded":1376429285,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 2.8.2"],"headings":["Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Transferase","Sulfonic_acid","Sulfate","3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate","Carbohydrate_sulfotransferase","CHST1","CHST2","CHST3","CHST4","CHST5","CHST6","CHST7","CHST8","CHST9","CHST10","CHST11","CHST12","CHST13","CHST14","Galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase","GAL3ST1","GAL3ST2","GAL3ST3","GAL3ST4","Heparan_sulfate_2-O-sulfotransferase","HS2ST1","Heparan_sulfate_3-O-sulfotransferase","HS3ST1","HS3ST2","HS3ST3A1","HS3ST3A2","HS3ST3B1","HS3ST3B2","HS3ST4","HS3ST5","HS3ST6","Heparan_sulfate_6-O-sulfotransferase","HS6ST1","HS6ST2","HS6ST3","N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase","NDST1","NDST2","NDST3","NDST4","Tyrosylprotein_sulfotransferase","TPST1","TPST2","Uronyl-2-sulfotransferase","UST","Estrone_sulfotransferase","Chondroitin_4-sulfotransferase","SULT1A1","SULT1A2","SULT1A3","SULT1A4","SULT1B1","SULT1C2","SULT1C3","SULT1C4","SULT1D1P","SULT1E1","SULT2A1","SULT2B1","SULT4A1","SULT6B1"]}
