The heart is provided by a special excitatory system and a contractile\nsystem necessary to perform this function.\n\nThis differentiation of the action potentials allows the different electrical\ncharacteristics of the different portions of the heart. For instance, the\nspecialized excitatory system of the heart has the special property of\ndepolarizing without any external influence with a slow, positive increase in\nvoltage across the cell's membrane (the membrane potential) that occurs between\nthe end of one action potential and the beginning of the next action potential.\nThis increase in membrane potential typically permits the membrane potential to\nreach the threshold potential at which it fires the next action potential\n(Pacemaker potential). Thus, the pacemaker potential is what drives the self-\ngenerated rhythmic firing. This is known as cardiac muscle automaticity.\n\nPacemaker potentials are fired by sinoatrial node (SAN), but also by the other\nfoci. However, the last ones have firing frequencies slower than the SAN's. When\nother foci attempt to fire at their intrinsic rate, they can't because they have\nbeen discharged by the previous electric impluse coming from the SAN before\ntheir pacemaker potential threshold is reached. This is called \"Overdrive\nsupression\". Rate dependence of action potential is a fundamental property of\ncardiac cells. This is important for the QT interval, measured from the\nbeginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. This interval must be\ncorrected for the cardiac rhythm QTc. A prolonged QTc, long QT syndrome, induced\nby drugs or disease congenital or acquired, increases the possibility of\ndeveloping severe ventricular arrhythmias and sometimes sudden death.\n\nThe electrical activity of the specialized excitatory tissues is not apparent on\nthe surface electrocardiogram (ECG). This is due to the relatively small time\nduration. Is not possible for example to see on the ECG the sinus node activity\nbut the resulting atria myocardium contraction is apparent as a wave: the P\nwave. The electrical activity of the conducting system can be seen on the ECG\n(the AV node delay, the so-called PR segment, for example).\n","linknr":-1,"url":"cardiac_action_potential","recorded":1376428673,"links":[],"instances":["biology","cardiac"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cardiac electrophysiology"],"headings":["Overview","Phases of the cardiac action potential","Refractory period","Channels","Automaticity","External links","See also","References","Bibliography","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["refractory_period","cardiac"],["hyperpolarization","biology"]],"members":["hyperpolarization","refractory_period"],"related":["Depolarizing","Cardiac_myocyte","Membrane_potential","Action_potential","Threshold_potential","Pacemaker_potential","Cardiac_muscle_automaticity","Sinoatrial_node","QT_interval","Electrocardiogram","Long_QT_syndrome","Electrocardiogram","Electrocardiogram","Skeletal_muscle","Membrane_potential","Cation","Phosphate","Conjugate_acid","Organic_acid","Anion","Sodium","Chloride","Sarcoplasmic_reticulum","Voltage-gated_calcium_channels","Calcium-induced_calcium_release","Muscle_contraction","Refractory_period_(cardiac)","Potassium_channels","Repolarization","Voltage-gated_calcium_channels","Syncytium","Cardiac_muscle_automaticity","Cardiac_pacemaker","Myocyte","Resting_membrane_potential","Potassium","Equilibrium_potential","Goldman_equation","Sodium","NaKATPase","Calcium","Inward-rectifier_potassium_ion_channel","Electric_current","Bertil_Hille","Atrioventricular_node","Bundle_of_His","Purkinje_fibers","Pacemaker_potential","Funny_current","Cardiac_dysrhythmia","Athletic_heart_syndrome","Diastole","Diastolic_depolarization","Cation","Anion","Action_potential","All-or-none_law","Slope","Ion_channel","Cardiac_arrhythmia","Voltage-dependent_calcium_channel","Sodium_channel","Cardiac_transient_outward_potassium_current","Potassium_channels","KvLQT1","Sodium-calcium_exchanger","Na-K_pump","Voltage_dependent_calcium_channel","KvLQT1","Potassium_channels","Membrane_potential","HERG","Inward-rectifier_potassium_ion_channel","Ion_channel","Voltage-gated_ion_channel","Ligand-gated_channel","SCN5A","CACNA1C","KCND2","KCND3","KCNQ1","HERG","KCNH2","Inward-rectifier_potassium_ion_channel","KCNJ2","KCNJ12","KCNJ4","Sodium-calcium_exchanger","SLC8A1","Na+/K+-ATPase","Calcium_ATPase","Gene","Molecular_biology","Hyperpolarization_(biology)","Cyclic_nucleotide","Funny_current","Sodium_channel","Voltage-dependent_calcium_channel","Cardiac_muscle","L-type_calcium_channel","T-type_calcium_channel","Sinoatrial_node","Electrical_conduction_system_of_the_heart","Electrical_conduction_system_of_the_heart","Excitationâ€“contraction_coupling","Action_potential","Antiarrhythmic_agents","Cardiac_arrhythmia","Cardiac_pacemaker","Resting_membrane_potential","Ventricular_action_potential"]}
