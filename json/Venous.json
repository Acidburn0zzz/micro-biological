Most veins carry deoxygenated blood from the\ntissues back to the heart; exceptions are the pulmonary and umbilical veins,\nboth of which carry oxygenated blood to the heart. Veins differ from arteries in\nstructure and function; for example, arteries are more muscular than veins,\nveins are often closer to the skin and contain valves to help keep blood flowing\ntoward the heart, while arteries carry blood away from the heart.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Venous","recorded":1376427892,"links":[],"instances":["vessels","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Veins"],"headings":["Anatomy","Function","Classification","Clinical significance","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["lumen","anatomy"],["tunica_externa","vessels"],["shock","circulatory#hypovolaemic"]],"members":["tunica_externa","shock","lumen"],"related":["Circulatory_system","Circulatory_system","Latin_language","Blood_vessels","Blood","Heart","Pulmonary_vein","Umbilical_vein","Artery","Arteries","Venous_valve","Arteries","Heart","Lumen_(anatomy)","Connective_tissue","Tunica_adventitia","Tunica_externa_(vessels)","Smooth_muscle","Tunica_media","Endothelium","Tunica_intima","Artery","Great_saphenous_vein","Persia","Avicenna","Fascial_compartment","Varicose_veins","Pulmonary_vein","Superior_vena_cava","Inferior_vena_cava","Portal_venous_system","Capillary_bed","Hepatic_portal_vein","Hypophyseal_portal_system","Thebesian_vein","Coronary_sinus","Dural_venous_sinuses","Arachnoid_villi","Venous_blood","Subcutis","Systemic_circulation","Left_ventricle","Artery","Capillary","Carbon_dioxide","Oxygen","Right_atrium","Right_ventricle","Lung","Pulmonary_circulation","Pulmonary_vein","Left_atrium","Skeletal-muscle_pump","Fainting","Baroreflex","Neurogenic_shock","Superficial_vein","Deep_vein","Communicating_veins","Pulmonary_vein","Lung","Systemic_vein","Thrombosis","Phlebologist","Impedance_phlebography","American_College_of_Phlebology","Australasian_College_of_Phlebology","American_Venous_Forum","Telangiectasia","Varicose_veins","Vein_stripping","Ambulatory_phlebectomy","Sclerotherapy","Laser","Postphlebitic_syndrome","Deep_vein_thrombosis","Thrombus","Pulmonary_embolism","Thrombus","Deep_vein","Deep_vein_thrombosis","Peripheral_vein","Phlebologist","Pulmonary_circulation","Superficial_vein","Varicose_veins"]}
