Keene, whose health was failing (he died in 1913), sold all his\nholdings in 1912 to Colonel Edward R. Bradley's Idle Hour Stock Farm in\nLexington, Kentucky. Some confusion occurred over this sale, and Bradley resold\nmost of the lot, but one of those he kept was a very dark brown yearling he\nnamed Black Toney. The price tag for the son of Hall of Famer Peter Pan, whose\nown sire was another Hall of Famer, Commando, by the great Domino, was $1,600.\nBlack Toney's dam was Belgravia, the best daughter of Hall of Famer Ben Brush.\nThis meant that the almost black yearling with no white markings and a fine head\nand body was a member of the last crop bred by Keene from his famous Domino/Ben\nBrush cross.\n\nBlack Toney was a good racehorse but far from a great one. He raced for four\nyears, coming in the money in 31 of his 40 starts. But it was not Black Toneyâs\nability on the track that made his name; it was his success as a stallion. Black\nToney became the most important stallion Bradley ever owned and one of the most\nimportant sires in American Thoroughbred history, siring many of the horses for\nwhich the Idle Hour Stock Farm became famous. The names of Bradleyâs horses all\nbegan with a âB,â a quirk of Bradley's (perhaps because his own name began with\na B, or perhaps because of Black Toney.)\n\nBriefly retired from the races due to injury, Black Toney sired one crop\nof horses. Of the resulting handful, one was Miss Jemima, an immediate\nstakes winner.\n\nOnce Black Toney was truly retired, Bradley bred him sparingly and yet, even\nfrom 21 small crops and a total of 221 foals, the quality of his get was\nvery high. Overall, he sired 40 stakes winners, which amounts to 18 percent\nof his foals.\n\nBlack Toney was 10 times among the top 20 American sires by earnings. He was\nsecond on the general sire list in 1933 and fifth in 1939.\n","linknr":155,"url":"Black_Toney","recorded":1376428068,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Black_Toney&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Black_Toney&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Toney","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources","/wiki/Peter_Pan_I","/wiki/Commando_(horse)","/w/index.php?title=Belgravia_(horse)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Ben_Brush","/wiki/Stallion","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Brown_(color)","/wiki/James_R._Keene","/wiki/Edward_R._Bradley","/w/index.php?title=Henry_J._Thompson&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Valuation_Stakes&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Latonia_Independence_Handicap&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Latonia_Race_Track","/wiki/James_R._Keene","/wiki/Castleton_Farm","/wiki/Edward_R._Bradley","/wiki/Idle_Hour_Stock_Farm","/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky","/wiki/National_Museum_of_Racing_and_Hall_of_Fame","/wiki/Peter_Pan_I","/wiki/Commando_(horse)","/wiki/Domino_(horse)","/wiki/Ben_Brush_(horse)","/wiki/Racehorse","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Thoroughbred","/w/index.php?title=Black_Toney&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Black_Toney&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Man_o%27_War","/wiki/Kentucky_Derby","/wiki/Blue_Larkspur","/wiki/Black_Gold_(horse)","/wiki/Bimelech","/wiki/La_Troienne","/wiki/Blood-Horse_magazine_List_of_the_Top_100_U.S._Racehorses_of_the_20th_Century","/wiki/Brokers_Tip","/w/index.php?title=Balladier&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Black_Maria_(horse)","/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks","/wiki/Black_Helen","/wiki/La_Troienne","/wiki/American_Champion_Three-Year-Old_Filly","/wiki/La_Troienne","/wiki/Broodmare","/wiki/France","/wiki/Man_o%27_War","/wiki/Blue_Larkspur","/wiki/Blood-Horse_magazine_List_of_the_Top_100_U.S._Racehorses_of_the_20th_Century","/wiki/Market_Wise","/wiki/Jockey_Club_Gold_Cup","/wiki/Whirlaway","/wiki/Searching_(horse)","/wiki/War_Admiral","/wiki/Affectionately","/wiki/Blood-Horse_magazine_List_of_the_Top_100_U.S._Racehorses_of_the_20th_Century","/w/index.php?title=Barn_Swallow_(horse)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks","/w/index.php?title=Baba_Kenny&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Big_Pebble","/w/index.php?title=Bridal_Flower&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Black_Toney&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Black_Toney&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/Bronze","/wiki/Darby_Dan_Farm","/w/index.php?title=Black_Toney&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Black_Toney&veaction=edit&section=3","http://www.pedigreequery.com/black+toney","http://www.equineinfo.com/horseracing/pBlackToney.htm","http://www.tbheritage.com/TurfHallmarks/Graves/cem/GraveMattersDarbyDan.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_Toney&oldid=545051684","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1911_racehorse_births","/wiki/Category:1938_racehorse_deaths","/wiki/Category:Thoroughbred_racehorses","/wiki/Category:American_racehorses","/wiki/Category:Animal_monuments","/wiki/Category:Racehorses_bred_in_Kentucky","/wiki/Category:United_States_Champion_Thoroughbred_Sires","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_reliable_references_from_January_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_reliable_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Black+Toney&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Black+Toney","/wiki/Black_Toney","/wiki/Talk:Black_Toney","#","/wiki/Black_Toney","/w/index.php?title=Black_Toney&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Black_Toney&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Black_Toney&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Conten
