For the band, see Cauterize (band)\n\n\n\nThe medical practice or technique of 'cauterization' is the burning of part of a\nbody to remove or close off a part of it in a process called 'cautery', which\ndestroys some tissue, in an attempt to mitigate damage, remove an undesired\ngrowth, or minimize other potential medical harmful possibilities such as\ninfections, when antibiotics are not available. The practice was once\nwidespread for treatment of wounds. Its utility before the advent of antibiotics\nwas effective on several levels:\n\n*To stop severe blood-loss and preventing exsanguination *To close amputations\n\nCautery was historically believed to prevent infection, but current research\nshows that cautery actually increases the risk for infection by causing more\ntissue damage and providing a more hospitable environment for bacterial\ngrowth.\n\n'Actual cautery' is a term referring to the metal device, generally heated to a\ndull red glow, that is applied to produce blisters, to stop bleeding of a blood\nvessel, and other similar purposes. , page 16.\n\nThe main forms of cauterization used today in the first world are\n'electrocautery' and 'chemical cautery'âwhere both are, for example, prevalent\nin the removal of unsightly warts. Cautery can also mean the branding of a\nhuman, either recreational or forced.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"cauterization","recorded":1376428436,"links":[],"instances":["injury","band","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical treatments","Surgery"],"headings":["History","Electrocautery","Chemical cautery","Nasal cauterization","Amputational cauterization","Infant circumcision","See also","References and notes","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["cauterize","band"],["burn","injury"],["ligature","medicine"],["ligature","medicine"]],"members":["burn","cauterize","ligature"],"related":["Cauterize_(band)","Burn_(injury)","Exsanguination","Amputation","Blisters","Bleeding","Blood_vessel","First_world","Wart","Human_branding","Amputation","Hippocratic_Corpus","Counter-irritant","Haemostatic","Tumour","Artery","Ligature_(medicine)","Ambroise_Paré","Heat_conduction","Ligature_(medicine)","Ultrasound","Warts","Hemostasis","Silver_nitrate","Lunar_caustic","Trichloroacetic_acid","Cantharidin","Blister_beetle","Nose_bleed","Liquid_nitrogen","Cocaine","Local_anesthetic","Vasoconstriction","Silver_nitrate","Hudud","Hudood","Circumcision","United_States","Canada","College_of_Physicians_and_Surgeons_of_Manitoba","Penis","Genital_modification_and_mutilation","New_York_Times","New_York_Times","Cryosurgery","Diathermy","Singe"]}
