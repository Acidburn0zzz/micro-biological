The\nfamily relocated to Memphis, Tennessee in 1952 where she attended Kingsbury Jr.\nHigh School. She also attended Humes High School\n[http://home.roadrunner.com/~hifiebay/humes.jpg] before her family relocated to\nDallas, Texas. She has been an active member of BMI (Broadcast Music\nIncorporated) as both a songwriter and publisher affiliate since 1965. She is\nco-owner of Silicon Music Publishing and many of her compositions have been\nrecorded by various artists. Her songs and published works have appeared on\nCapri Records, Tear Drop Records, Charay Records, Mister Rock Records, Enviken\nRecords, Le Cam Records, Country Disco Records, Rollercoaster Records, Primo\nRecords, Crystal Clear Sound Records, Collector Records, Collectable Records,\nBig Beat Records, Lake County Records, Domino Records, Front Row Records,\nMaridene Records, Helvis Records, W&G Records.\n\nIn 1977 she wrote \"Goodbye Priscilla (Bye Bye Baby Blue)\" as a tribute to Elvis\nPresley and Priscilla Presley. The song was issued by Tear Drop Records in 1977\nand became one of her most popular compositions. The \"Goodbye Priscilla\" 45 is\nnow a much sought after collectible and has been issued on several Elvis\n\"tribute\" compilation albums and CDs. She later met with Priscilla Presley and\npersonally presented her with a copy of the original 45rpm record. When \"Goodbye\nPriscilla\" was first released in 1977 there was some confusion about which\nPriscilla it was written for-Priscilla Presley or Priscilla Davis who was a main\ncharacter in the famous Cullen Davis Murder Trials. In his book \"Blood Will Tell-\nThe Murder Trials Of Cullen Davis\" author Gary Cartwright credits the song (page\n199) as referring to Priscilla Davis. However, this song was written solely for\nPriscilla Presley as a tribute to Elvis.\n\nSummers was profiled in the Dictionary of International Biography (1982 Edition\npublished by IBC Cambridge). She is also profiled in Songwriter's Market\n(1979âPresent) published by Writer's Digest Books.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Deanna_Summers","recorded":1376424719,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Deanna_Summers&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Deanna_Summers&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deanna_Summers","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Mississippi","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Popular_music","/wiki/Rock_and_Roll","/wiki/Songwriter","/wiki/Music_publisher_(popular_music)","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Capri_Records","/wiki/Tear_Drop_Records","http://capitolsoulclub.homestead.com/Charaylisting.html","/wiki/Songwriter","/wiki/Mississippi","/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee","http://home.roadrunner.com/~hifiebay/humes.jpg","/wiki/Dallas,_Texas","/wiki/Broadcast_Music_Incorporated","/wiki/Songwriter","/wiki/Publisher","/wiki/Musical_composition","/wiki/Goodbye_Priscilla_(Bye_Bye_Baby_Blue)","/wiki/Elvis_Presley","/wiki/Priscilla_Presley","/wiki/Musical_composition","/wiki/45_(record)","/wiki/Collectible","/wiki/Elvis","/wiki/Tribute","/wiki/Compilation_album","/wiki/CDs","/wiki/Priscilla_Presley","/wiki/45rpm","/wiki/Gramophone_record","/wiki/Priscilla_Presley","/wiki/Priscilla_Davis","/wiki/Cullen_Davis","/w/index.php?title=Deanna_Summers&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Deanna_Summers&veaction=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Proseline","/wiki/Wikipedia:Embedded_list","/wiki/Help:Editing","/wiki/Writer","/wiki/Songwriter","/wiki/Music_publisher_(popular_music)","/wiki/Moondog_Mayne","/wiki/Goodbye_Priscilla_(Bye_Bye_Baby_Blue)","/wiki/Grand_Ole_Opry","/wiki/Bonnie_Parker","/w/index.php?title=Deanna_Summers&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Deanna_Summers&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deanna_Summers&oldid=548353948","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Songwriters_from_Texas","/wiki/Category:People_from_Mississippi","/wiki/Category:People_from_Dallas,_Texas","/wiki/Category:People_from_Memphis,_Tennessee","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Humes_High_School","/wiki/Category:People_from_Garland,_Texas","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_November_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_cleanup_from_November_2010","/wiki/Category:All_pages_needing_cleanup","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_sections_that_need_to_be_turned_into_prose_from_November_2010","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_missing_(living_people)","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Deanna+Summers&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Deanna+Summers","/wiki/Deanna_Summers","/wiki/Talk:Deanna_Summers","#","/wiki/Deanna_Summers","/w/index.php?title=Deanna_Summers&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Deanna_Summers&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Deanna_Summers&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Deanna_Summers","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Deanna_Summers","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php
