He has been credited with the\ndiscovery the female hormone progesterone, which is released after ovulation.\nStudies on progesterone, which Dr. Slotta found sends chemical signals to the\nbrain that prevent ovulation, eventually led to the development of birth control\npills in the 1950s.\n\nSlotta was drafted into military service in World War I, with service reflected\nin German casualty lists for that period. After the war, Slotta began his\nhormone research at the Chemical Institute in Breslau, Germany, under the\nguidance of Professor Ludwig Fraenkel. Slotta obtained his PhD in chemistry from\nthe University of Breslau in 1923. He continued post-doc work at the university\nwith guidance from Professor Fraenkel. In 1933 Slotta was first, or one of the\nof the first, to isolate and identify progesterone (there being four separate\nresearch labs which claim such distinction [4]). In 1934 he proposed a correct\nstructural formula for the hormone. While working at the Chemistry Institute of\nthe University of Vienna, Slotta synthesized compounds, analogous to plant\nextract from French lilac (Galega officinalis), then used to treat symptoms of\ndiabetes. The synthetic, marketed as Synthalin, proved less toxic and more\npotent than prior plant products. Slotta was appointed professor of chemistry in\n1935, but, during the rise of the National Socialist regime was summarily\ndismissed from his position, becoming one of the legion of German scholars\n\"displaced\" by the Nazis [1]. As persecution escalated, in 1935 he left Germany\nwith his family for the safety of Brazil.\n\nIn Brazil, Slotta initially worked on the chemistry of coffee, from which bean\noil he extracted a substance he called \"cafestol\" that he reported had\nestrogenic properties.[2] As a result, European pharmaceutical companies sought\nto duplicate his work, in the hope of producing steroidal sex hormone from such\nan abundant and inexpensive material. The project proved unsuccessful, however,\nSlotta was recognized with an appointment at the Instituto Butantan, a Brazilian\nbiomedical research center of the SÃ£o Paulo State Secretary of Health, located\nnear the campus of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. In 1935 he was appointed\ndirector of the Chemical Institute, primarily engaged in the production of\nantivenins to treat local farmers. In time, the Institute developed basic and\napplied biomedical research in many areas, including molecular biology,\nimmunology and epidemiology. The center has a graduate training program in\ncollaboration with other institutions, in the areas of biotechnology and\ninfectology, with research laboratories, production units and specialized\nlibrary. Slotta, a sterol chemist, studied medical applications of snake venom.\nIn 1938 Slotta and his brother-in-law Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat isolated crotoxin\nfrom venom, the first snake toxin to be isolated in crystalline form.[3] Their\nresearch suggested that the toxicity of crotoxin was due to effects on nerve\nlipids. He subsequently co-founded a biopharmaceutical company.\n\nOn May 3, 1948 Slotta traveled from Santos, Brazil aboard the steamer, S.S.\nArgentina, arriving in at the Port of New York, May 17, 1948, with his wife Maja\nSlotta, and daughter. They were bound for Berkeley, California, where Maja's\nbrother, Heinz had relocated. Maja Fraenkel's brother, Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat,\n(July 29, 1910 â April 10, 1999), was a biochemist, famous for his viral\nresearch. Fraenkel-Conrat was born in Breslau, Germany and received an M.D.,\nfrom the University of Breslau in 1933. Due to the rise of Nazism in Germany he\nleft Germany for Scotland in 1933 and finished his PhD at the University of\nEdinburgh in 1936. After completing his doctorate, he immigrated to the United\nStates, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1941. He worked at a number of\ninstitutes before joining the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley\nin 1952 where he remained until his death.\n\nAfter moving to Miami, Florida with his wife and son in the 1956, Slotta\nunsuccessfully looked for a polio cure using venom. In 1956 Slotta was\nappointed research professor of biochemistry at the University of Miami,\nFlorida. Slotta purified the most basic polypeptide from Naja naja venom, known\nas direct lytic factor, and with James Vick identified this as cardiotoxin.\nSlotta became a naturalized United States citizen March 30, 1961 in Miami,\nFlorida. He continued to train the next generation of biochemists at his\nlaboratory at the University of Miami.\n\nFamily\n\nOn July 16, 1927, Karl Slotta married Maja Fraenkel, PhD, daughter of Professor\nLudwig Fraenkel (1870â1951)and Lili Conrat, in Breslau, Germany. Ludwig Fraenkel\nwas a prominent gynecologist and medical researcher in Breslau, Germany.\nFraenkel's daughter, Maja Fraenkel (Slotta) was an economist, talented pianist,\nand author of a study, published in 1928 analyzing Zur Frage der\npsychotechnischen EignungsprÃ¼fung fÃ¼r den Chemikerberuf. The couple met through\nSlotta's work with Professor Frankel. Maja at the time was associated with the\nPsychotechnisches Institute beim Berufsami der Stadt Breslau. Her own career as\na researcher was largely redirected to a supportive role after the birth of two\nchildren, Sabine and Peter. After immigration to the United States, in Miami, in\n1956 she was an early organizer of the Medical Faculty Wives Medical Student\nLoan Fund, established under auspices of the Medical Faculty Association of the\nUniversity of Miami (of which her husband was a member, as Research Professor of\nBiochemistry and Medicine). Maja Slotta identified and secured Federal funds\nthat matched donations nine to one, thereby facilitating the early growth of\nthis fund. Providing funds and assistance to the medical students became the\nprimary endeavor of the group. The project has since grown into a successful\nscholarship endowment. Maja resumed research after raising her children and was\nco-author of a 1961 study on The Impact of Airports on the Economy of\nSoutheastern Florida, published by University of Miami Bureau of Business and\nEconomic Research.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Karl_Slotta","recorded":1376425097,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Karl_Slotta&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Slotta&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Slotta","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karl_Slotta&action=edit","/wiki/Talk:Karl_Slotta","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Ambox_wikify.svg/40px-Ambox_wikify.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Linking","/wiki/Wikipedia:BUILD","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karl_Slotta&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Only_make_links_that_are_relevant_to_the_context","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Progesterone","/wiki/University_of_Breslau","/wiki/Synthalin","/wiki/Instituto_Butantan","/wiki/Heinz_Fraenkel-Conrat","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Slotta&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Slotta&veaction=edit&section=1","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041010100002646","/wiki/Toxicon","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karl_Slotta&oldid=563314397","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1895_births","/wiki/Category:University_of_Breslau_alumni","/wiki/Category:University_of_Miami_faculty","/wiki/Category:American_biochemists","/wiki/Category:German_emigrants_to_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:1987_deaths","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_missing_files","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_February_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_too_few_wikilinks_from_February_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_too_few_wikilinks","/wiki/Category:Articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify_from_February_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Karl+Slotta&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Karl+Slotta","/wiki/Karl_Slotta","/wiki/Talk:Karl_Slotta","#","/wiki/Karl_Slotta","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Slotta&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Slotta&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Slotta&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Karl_Slotta","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Karl_Slotta","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Slotta&oldid=563314397","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Slotta&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6372263","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Karl_Slotta&id=563314397","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Karl+Slotta","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Karl+Slotta&oldid=563314397&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Slotta&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6372263#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediaf
