{"cursor":"7527","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The Gellish English Dictionary-Taxonomy is an example of an open-source âsmartâ\nelectronic dictionary, which concepts are arranged in a subtype-supertype\nhierarchy, thus forming a taxonomy. The dictionary-taxonomy is a machine\nreadable. It is compliant with the guidelines of ISO 16354. Apart from the fact\nthat it is an English (business-technical) dictionary it also defines the\nsemantics of Gellish English, which is a computer interpretable structured\nsubset of the natural English language for data storage and data exchange. The\ndictionary-taxonomy differs from conventional dictionaries because of several\nadditional capabilities. Therefore it is called \"smart\". This means that it\nsatisfies the following criteria:\n\n* It contains definitions per concept (each represented by a unique identifier\n  (UID)), whereas ordinary dictionaries usually provide multiple different\n  definitions of a single term, whereas it is unclear whether those definitions\n  are alternative definitions of the same concept or whether they are\n  definitions of different concepts. Thus a smart dictionary explicitly\n  distinguished homonyms (the same term for different concepts) and explicitly\n  specifies which terms are used as true synonyms, including also abbreviations,\n  codes, etc.\n* It is defined itself in the form of a Gellish Data Tables that form a\n  Gellish Database.\n* It is completely arranged as a taxonomy, which is a subtype-supertype\n  hierarchy of concepts. This means that each concept is defined as an explicit\n  subtype of one or more supertype concepts by specialization relations. This\n  enables inheritance of definitions, knowledge and requirements. An example of\n  some definitions and hierarchy is the following:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Left hand UID !! Left hand term !! Relation type UID !! Relation type phrase\n! !! Right hand UID !! Right hand term !! Definition\n|- 131737 || line shaft pump || 1146 || is a specialization of || 130058 ||\n|centrifugal pump || is a centrifugal pump that has ... - 130058 || centrifugal\n|pump || 1146 || is a specialization of || 130206 || pump || is a pump that ...\n|- 130206 || pump || 1146 || is a specialization of || 730006 || equipment item\n||| is an equipment item that ... }\n* It includes also concepts with multi-term names. For example: line shaft\n  centrifugal pump. Ordinary dictionaries will only define the separate terms,\n  from which it cannot always be inferred what the multi-term means.\n* It defines kinds of relations, also called relation types or fact types, being\n  special kinds of concepts. Such kinds of facts do not appear in ordinary\n  dictionaries, because they are word based and do not recognize standard\n  phrases. However, fact types represent semantic concepts that are used by\n  everybody to make sentences. Because these relation types are standardized and\n  unambiguously defined, Gellish English becomes computer interpretable. The\n  relation types in the dictionary-taxonomy include kinds that are specific for\n  the expression of facts that represent knowledge, requirements, definitions\n  and information about individual things. The relation types have names and\n  synonyms that consist of standardized phrases. For example (for clarity the\n  UID's are not shown): {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Left hand term !! Relation type phrase !! Right hand term\n|- is a part of || is a specialization of || relation between individual things\n|- can have as part a || is a specialization of || relation between kinds of\n|things - shall have as part a || is a specialization of || can be a part of a }\n\nThe phrase 'is a part of' is a standard phrase for composition relations that\ncan be used to express facts that relates parts to wholes. The other standard\nphrase 'can have as part a', is a phrase for a concept that can be used to\nexpress knowledge that a whole of a particular kind can have as a part a\ncomponent of a particular kind. The 'shall have as part a' relation is intended\nto be used to express requirements. All phrases have also inverse expressions,\nsuch as 'has as part' and 'can be a part of a', which denote the same concepts\n(relation types), but which require an inverse sequence of the related objects.\nThe following table illustrates the use of these relation types in Gellish\nEnglish expressions.  {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Left hand term !! Relation type phrase !! Right hand term\n|- B1 || is a part of || P-101 - B1 || is classified as a || bearing - P-101 ||\n|is classified as a || pump type A - pump || can have as part a || bearing -\n|pump type A || shall have as part a || bearing }\n\n** Note: All elements in the above last two expression (pump, can/shall have as\npart a, and bearing) are 'names' of standard English concepts that are defined\nin the Gellish English Dictionary-Taxonomy or a proprietary extension, such as\nfor 'pump type A'.\n* It includes explicit relations between concepts, using the above mentioned\n  standardized relation types. Those relations express knowledge about the\n  concepts. This makes that the dictionary-taxonomy is also called an ontology.\n  If a user of an application system classifies an individual object by a\n  concept in the dictionary-taxonomy, then a computer system can infer that the\n  knowledge and requirements about the concept are applicable to that individual\n  object and it can make that information available to that user. This includes\n  also the knowledge and requirements that are available about the supertypes of\n  that concepts, because such knowledge and requirements are inherited by the\n  subtype of those supertype concepts, conform the subtype-supertype hierarchy\n  (the taxonomy).\n* It enables automatic translation and search in databases in other languages.\n  This is enabled, because each concept is represented by a language independent\n  unique identifier (UID, a natural number), whereas multiple terms (names) in\n  various languages are allowed to denote the same concept. This enables that\n  facts that are expressed in one language can be automatically presented by a\n  computer in any other language for which a smart dictionary is available. It\n  also enables that queries in one language can be answered by database systems\n  that contain facts that are expressed other languages, whereas the results can\n  be presented in the language in which the query was formulated.\n* It can be extended by private and proprietary concepts and terms. For example,\n  company specific codes and proprietary knowledge can be added when required.\n  Guidelines for the 'proper definition of a concept' are provided in the\n  documentation.\n* It is computer interpretable and system independent.\n\nThe Gellish English Dictionary-Taxonomy is available as a collection of\nstandardized Gellish Data Tables. Each of those tables has the same standard\ncolumn definitions. Thus the whole dictionary-taxonomy can be treated as if it\nwas one table.
