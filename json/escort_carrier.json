{"cursor":"29176","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'escort aircraft carrier' or 'escort carrier', also called a \"jeep carrier\"\nor \"baby flattop\" in the USN or \"Woolworth Carrier\" by the Royal Navy, was a\nsmall and slow type of aircraft carrier used by the Royal Navy (RN), the\nImperial Japanese Navy and Imperial Japanese Army Air Force, and the United\nStates Navy (USN) in World War II. They were typically half the length and 1/3\nthe displacement of the larger fleet carriers. While they were slower, less\narmed and armored, and carried fewer planes, they were less expensive and could\nbe built in less time. This was their principal advantage, as escort carriers\ncould be completed in greater numbers as a stop-gap when fleet carriers were\nscarce. However, the lack of protection made escort carriers particularly\nvulnerable and several were sunk with great loss of life. The light carrier\n(hull classification symbol CVL) was a similar concept to escort carriers in\nmost respects, however they were intended for higher speeds to be deployed\nalongside fleet carriers.\n\nMost often built on a commercial ship hull, escort carriers were too slow to\nkeep up with the main forces consisting of fleet carriers, battleships, and\ncruisers. Instead, they were used to escort convoys, defending them from enemy\nthreats such as submarines and planes. In the invasions of mainland Europe and\nPacific islands, escort carriers provided air support to ground forces during\namphibious operations. Escort carriers also served as backup aircraft\ntransports for fleet carriers, and ferried aircraft of all military services to\npoints of delivery.\n\nIn the Atlantic, the escort carriers were used to protect convoys against U-\nboats. Initially escort carriers accompanied the merchant ships and fended off\nattacks from aircraft and submarines. Later in the war, escort carriers were\npart of hunter-killer groups which sought out submarines instead of being\nattached to a particular convoy.\n\nIn the Pacific theater, CVEs provided air support of ground troops in the Battle\nof Leyte Gulf. They lacked the speed and weapons to counter enemy fleets,\nrelying on the protection of a Fast Carrier Task Force. However, at the Battle\noff Samar, one U.S. task force of escort carriers and destroyers known as \"Taffy\n3\" was left unprotected after the powerful 3rd Fleet, under the command of\nAdmiral William Halsey, Jr. was lured away to pursue decoy carriers. It found\nitself confronted by a massive Japanese force of battleships and cruisers.\nNevertheless, the Japanese were turned back by a furious defense by screening\nU.S. destroyers and destroyer escorts, which made torpedo runs and accurate gun\nattacks, as well as aircraft which attacked without carrying effective anti-ship\nbombs and torpedoes. The U.S. sank three Japanese cruisers in that engagement,\nat the cost of one escort carrier, two destroyers and one destroyer escort.\n\nOf the 151 aircraft carriers built in the U.S. during World War II, 122 were\nescort carriers. Though no examples survive to this day, the ''Casablanca''\nclass holds the distinction of being the most numerous single class of aircraft\ncarrier ever built, with 50 having been launched. The ''Bogue'' class comes in a\nclose second, with 45 launched.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"escort_carrier","recorded":1376419441,"links":[],"instances":["strategy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ship types","Aircraft carriers","Escort carriers"],"headings":["Development","Royal Navy","U.S. Navy Service","Escort carrier tactics when escorting convoys","The ships","Relative carrier sizes in World War II","Post-World War II","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["battle_of_the_atlantic","1939–1945"],["battle_of_the_atlantic","1939–1945"],["leapfrogging","strategy"],["fighter_aircraft#first_generation_jet_fighters","1944-1953"]],"members":["leapfrogging","battle_of_the_atlantic"],"related":["Aircraft_carrier","Royal_Navy","Imperial_Japanese_Navy","United_States_Navy","World_War_II","Light_aircraft_carrier","Hull_classification_symbol","Air_support","Amphibious_operation","Battle_of_the_Atlantic_(1939–1945)","U-boat","Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf","Fast_Carrier_Task_Force","Battle_off_Samar","William_Halsey,_Jr.","Casablanca_class_escort_carrier","Bogue_class_escort_carrier","Washington_Naval_Treaty","Battle_of_Taranto","Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor","Light_aircraft_carrier","Hull_classification_symbol","Fighter_catapult_ship","CAM_Ship","Merchant_aircraft_carrier","William_F._Halsey,_Jr.","Operation_Torch","Hangar","Essex_class_carrier","Chimney","Gedunk_bar","Ice_cream","Vending_machine","Sangamon_class_escort_carrier","Type_C3_ship","United_Kingdom","Battle_of_the_Atlantic_(1939–1945)","Convoy","Royal_Navy","Lend-Lease","Merchant_aircraft_carrier","Grog","Alcoholic_beverage","Washing_machine","Bucket","Soap","North_Atlantic","Arctic_convoys","Destroyer","Pacific_War","Leapfrogging_(strategy)","Battle_off_Samar","William_Halsey,_Jr.","United_States_Third_Fleet","Destroyer_escort","Battleship","Cruiser","Dual_purpose_gun","Battle_of_Coral_Sea","Battle_of_Midway","Convoy","Admiralty","Lend-Lease","United_Kingdom","Long_Island_class_escort_carrier","Avenger_class_escort_carrier","Sangamon_class_escort_carrier","Bogue_class_escort_carrier","Casablanca_class_escort_carrier","Commencement_Bay_class_escort_carrier","Merchant_aircraft_carrier","Bogue_class_escort_carrier","Merchant_aircraft_carrier","Casablanca_class_escort_carrier","Merchant_aircraft_carrier","Merchant_aircraft_carrier","Commencement_Bay_class_escort_carrier","Illustrious_class_aircraft_carrier","Helicopter","Commencement_Bay_class_escort_carrier","Korean_War","Frigates","Guided_missile","In-flight_refueling","Vietnam_War","South_Vietnam","Helicopter_carrier","Amphibious_warfare","Amphibious_assault_ship","Amphibious_command_ship","Blue_Ridge_class_command_ship","Light_aircraft_carrier","Sea_Control_Ship","Spanish_aircraft_carrier_Principe_de_Asturias","HTMS_Chakri_Naruebet","CAM_ship","Merchant_aircraft_carrier","List_of_escort_carriers_by_country","List_of_escort_aircraft_carriers_of_the_United_States_Navy","List_of_sunken_aircraft_carriers","List_of_escort_aircraft_carriers_of_the_Royal_Navy","List_of_ships_of_the_Japanese_Navy"]}
