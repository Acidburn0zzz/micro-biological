He\nhas published several works on psychotherapy.\n\nPat De Mare was born in London, the son of B E A de Mare who was of Swedish\norigin. He was educated at St Cyprian's School, Wellington College and\nPeterhouse College, Cambridge. He trained for medicine at St George's Hospital\nand qualified as a doctor in 1941. He enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps\nin 1942, and was trained for Army psychiatry by Rickman and Wilfred Bion at\nNorthfield Hospital. It was an interesting time to work as a psychiatrist: the\nFirst World War had seen ground-breaking work in diagnosing and treating trauma,\nand with battle casualties arriving home, Dr De Mare had plenty of patients to\nlook after and study. He ran an Exhaustion Centre throughout the European\ncampaign, Roger Chickering, Stig FÃ¶rster The Shadows of Total War: Europe,\nEast Asia, and the United States Cambridge University Press 2003 ISBN 0-521-81236-\n4 at the end of which he returned to Northfield Hospital, where he joined\nS. H. Foulkes and Tom Main in the Northfield experiment. Northfield became the\ncentre of a series of experiments led by these eminent physicians, which studied\nhow to deal with trauma caused by war.\n\nAfter World War II he became a Consultant Psychotherapist at St George's\nHospital. In 1952 he set up the Group Analytic Society with Foulkes, and later\nhe participated in setting up the Institute of Group Analysis and the Group\nAnalytic Practice. He also worked with Benaim and Lionel Kreeger at Halliwick\nHospital, the short-lived therapeutic community.\n\nDe Mare devoted his skills to the practice of group psychotherapy, starting in\nthe traditional small group psychotherapeutic setting, but progressing towards\nthe experience and application of large groups, and later still developing his\nmain interest of the median group.\n\nIn 1960, Wilfred Foulkes and Dr De Mare set up a private clinic, the Group-\nAnalytic Practice. From this work sprung the Group Analytic Society and then, in\n1971, the Institute of Group Analysis. He had moved from Fitzrovia to Redington\nRoad, Hampstead, in the 1960s and away from his work he became known for his\nlove of good food, music and hosting parties.\n\nIn 1972 he published Perspectives in Group Psychotherapy and in 1974 Lionel\nKreeger and he published Introduction to Group Treatment in Psychiatry, which\nwas dedicated to the patients and staff at Halliwick Hospital.\n\nIn 1975 he started a large group under the auspices of the Institute of Group\nAnalysis; in 1976 he was joined by Robin Piper. That 'large' group settled down\nto a steady membership of about 20 members and became a 'median' group. In 1984\nhe launched a weekly seminar on large groups that, in 1986, became part of a\nrecognised large group section of the Group Analytic Society. He worked for many\nyears at the Group Analytic Practice in London.\n\nDavid Bohm underwent psychotherapy with de Mare and was heavily influenced by\nhis work. David Bohm, F.

He would\nplay his accordion at bars and cafÃ©s in Hampstead. He also had a love of opera,\nand would play music at his practice in Baker Street.\n\nAfter a long and debilitating illness resulting from a street accident he\neventually died from pneumonia at the age of 92.\n","linknr":117,"url":"Patrick_De_Mare","recorded":1376429230,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Patrick_De_Mare&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Patrick_De_Mare&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_De_Mare","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/St_Cyprian%27s_School","/wiki/Wellington_College,_Berkshire","/wiki/Peterhouse_College,_Cambridge","/wiki/St_George%27s_Hospital","/wiki/Royal_Army_Medical_Corps","/wiki/Wilfred_Bion","/wiki/Northfield_Hospital","#cite_note-1","/wiki/S._H._Foulkes","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Main&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Group_Analytic_Society","/wiki/Institute_of_Group_Analysis","/w/index.php?title=Lionel_Kreeger&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/David_Bohm","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Patrick_De_Mare&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Patrick_De_Mare&veaction=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Patrick_De_Mare&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Patrick_De_Mare&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0521812364","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0415171822","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Special:BookSources/8890196017","/w/index.php?title=Patrick_De_Mare&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Patrick_De_Mare&veaction=edit&section=3","http://www.duversity.org/patrick_demare.htm","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/227285303","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Patrick_De_Mare&oldid=544833109","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1916_births","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Wellington_College,_Berkshire","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Peterhouse,_Cambridge","/wiki/Category:Psychologists","/wiki/Category:Psychotherapists","/wiki/Category:Group_psychotherapists","/wiki/Category:Royal_Army_Medical_Corps_officers","/wiki/Category:British_Army_personnel_of_World_War_II","/wiki/Category:2008_deaths","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_April_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Patrick+De+Mare&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Patrick+De+Mare","/wiki/Patrick_De_Mare","/wiki/Talk:Patrick_De_Mare","#","/wiki/Patrick_De_Mare","/w/index.php?title=Patrick_De_Mare&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Patrick_De_Mare&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Patrick_De_Mare&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Patrick_De_Mare","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Patrick_De_Mare","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Patrick_De_Mare&oldid=544833109","/w/index.php?title=Patrick_De_Mare&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1247029","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Patrick_De_Mare&id=544833109","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Patrick+De+Mare","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Patrick+De+Mare&oldid=544833109&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Patrick_De_Mare&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_DeMare","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1247029#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//
