As a cereal grain, it is the most widely\nconsumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population,\nespecially in Asia. It is the grain with the second-highest worldwide\nproduction, after maize (corn), according to data for 2010.\n\nSince a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human\nconsumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition\nand caloric intake, providing more than one fifth of the calories consumed\nworldwide by the human species. Smith, Bruce D. (1998) The Emergence of\nAgriculture. Scientific American Library, A Division of HPHLP, New York, ISBN\n0-7167-6030-4.\n\nGenetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication\n8,200â13,500 years ago, in the Pearl River valley region of\nChina. Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested\nthat rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China. From East Asia, rice spread to Southeast and South Asia. Rice was introduced to Europe through Western Asia, and to the\nAmericas through European colonization.\n\nThere are many varieties of rice and culinary preferences tend to vary\nregionally. In the Far East, there is a preference for softer and stickier\nvarieties.\n\nRice is normally grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can\nsurvive as a perennial and can produce a ratoon crop for up to 30 years.

It\nhas long, slender leaves long and broad. The small wind-pollinated flowers are\nproduced in a branched arching to pendulous inflorescence long. The edible seed\nis a grain (caryopsis) long and thick. '', commonly known as Asian rice]] Rice\ncultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and\nhigh rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water.\nRice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain.\nAlthough its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa,\ncenturies of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures\nworldwide.\n\nThe traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or\nafter, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound planning\nand servicing of the water damming and channeling, but reduces the growth of\nless robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters\nvermin. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other\nmethods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during\ngrowth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.\n\nThe name '[[wild rice]]' is usually used for species of the grass genus\n[[Zizania (genus)|Zizania]], both wild and domesticated, although the term may\nalso be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of [[Oryza]].\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Rice","recorded":1376428935,"links":[],"instances":["botany","china","grains","biology","geography","philippines","food","cooking","organism","mass"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Crops
