It is a hexa-peptide\ncontaining the unusual amino acid statine ('Sta', (3S,4S)-4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-\nmethylheptanoic acid), having the sequence Isovaleryl-Val-Val-Sta-Ala-Sta (Iva-Val-Val-Sta-Ala-\nSta). It was originally isolated from cultures of\nvarious species of Actinomyces due to its ability to\ninhibit pepsin at picomolar concentrations.\nPepstatin A is well known to be an inhibitor of aspartic proteinases such as\npepsin, cathepsins D and E. Except for its role as a proteinase inhibitor,\nhowever, the pharmacological action of pepstatin A upon cells remain unclear.\nPepstatin A suppresses receptor activator of NF-ÎºB ligand (RANKL)âinduced\nosteoclast differentiation. Pepstatin A suppresses the formation of multinuclear\nosteoclasts dose-dependently. This inhibition of the formation only affected\nosteoclast cells, i.e., not osteoblast-like cells. Furthermore, pepstatin A also\nsuppresses differentiation from pre-osteoclast cells to mononuclear osteoclast\ncells dose-dependently. This inhibition seems to be independent of the\nactivities of proteinases such as cathepsin D, because the formation of\nosteoclasts was not suppressed with the concentration that inhibited the\nactivity of cathepsin D. Cell signaling analysis indicated that the\nphosphorylation of ERK was inhibited in pepstatin A-treated cells, while the\nphosphorylation of IÎºB and Akt showed almost no change. Furthermore, pepstatin A\ndecreased the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1).\nThese results suggest that pepstatin A suppresses the differentiation of\nosteoclasts through the blockade of ERK signaling and the inhibition of NFATc1\nexpression.\n\nPepstatin is practically insoluble in water, chloroform, ether, and benzene,\nhowever it can be dissolved in methanol, ethanol and DMSO with acetic\nacid, The Merck Index - An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs, and Biologicals\n(14th Edition - Version 14.4), Monograph '07147', ISBN 978-1-60119-491-6\nto between 1 and 5 mg/ml. ]\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Pepstatin","recorded":1376427637,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Peptides"],"headings":["References"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Aspartyl_protease","Peptide","Statine","Actinomyces","Pepsin"]}
