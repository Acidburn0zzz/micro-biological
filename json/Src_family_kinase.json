{"cursor":"2207","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Src family kinase' is a family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases that includes\nnine members: Src, Yes, Fyn, and Fgr, forming the SrcA subfamily, Lck, Hck, Blk,\nand Lyn in the SrcB subfamily, and Frk in its own subfamily. Frk has homologs in\ninvertebrates such as flies and worms, and Src homologs exist in organisms as\ndiverse as unicellular choanoflagellates, but the SrcA and SrcB subfamilies are\nspecific to vertebrates.\n\nSrc family kinases interact with many cellular cytosolic, nuclear and\nmembrane proteins, modifying these proteins by phosphorylation of tyrosine\nresidues. A number of substrates have been discovered for these\nenzymes.
