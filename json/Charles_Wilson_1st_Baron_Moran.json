Born in\nSkipton, Yorkshire, he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps during the First\nWorld War. He won the Military Cross in 1916.\n\nMoran's book, The Struggle for Survival is about Churchill during and after the\nwar. It describes his failing health in detail. The book was published fifteen\nmonths after Churchill's death and caused a great deal of controversy as a\nresult of what was seen as a breach of patient-physician confidentiality. [http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cats/20/4599.htm Wellcome Library]\n\nHe was the Dean of St Mary's Hospital Medical School between 1920 and 1945,\nwhere he oversaw the rebuilding of the premises. He was a prominent scientist in\nhis day, and was elected President of the Royal College of Physicians in April\n1941 and was re-elected each year until 1950, when he resigned in favour of\nRussell Brain.\n\nHe was knighted in 1942 and created Baron Moran in the New Year honours of 1943\nand made his maiden speech in the House of Lords, the same year, on the\nBeveridge Report. He was also involved in many other debates\non the National Health Service.\n\nLord Moran had two sons, John (the present Baron) and Geoffrey. He was survived\nby his wife Dorothy (nÃ©e Dufton), who died in 1983.\n\nDuring his time as Sir Winston Churchill's private doctor he met several\nprominent figures, such as Anthony Eden, Field-Marshal Montgomery (later the 1st\nViscount Montgomery of Alamein) and Lord Mountbatten of Burma. Churchill's\nPrivate Secretary, Sir John (Jock) Colville, wrote: \"Lord Moran was never\npresent when history was made but he was invited to luncheon afterwards.\"\n","linknr":135,"url":"Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran","recorded":1376418980,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Military_Cross","/wiki/Winston_Churchill","/wiki/Yorkshire","/wiki/Royal_Army_Medical_Corps","/wiki/First_World_War","/wiki/Military_Cross","#cite_note-wellcome-1","/wiki/St_Mary%27s_Hospital_Medical_School","/wiki/Royal_College_of_Physicians","/wiki/Russell_Brain","#cite_note-wellcome-1","/wiki/Knight_Bachelor","/wiki/Baron_Moran","/wiki/House_of_Lords","/wiki/Beveridge_Report","#cite_note-wellcome-1","/wiki/National_Health_Service","#cite_note-wellcome-1","/wiki/John_Wilson,_2nd_Baron_Moran","/wiki/Anthony_Eden","/wiki/Bernard_Montgomery,_1st_Viscount_Montgomery_of_Alamein","/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Archibald_Constable","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0094513902","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0786717068","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0786710411","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-wellcome_1-0","#cite_ref-wellcome_1-1","#cite_ref-wellcome_1-2","#cite_ref-wellcome_1-3","http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cats/20/4599.htm","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran&veaction=edit&section=3","http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=4599&inst_id=20","http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person.php?LinkID=mp50940","/wiki/National_Portrait_Gallery,_London","/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_Royal_College_of_Physicians","/wiki/Walter_Russell_Brain","/wiki/Peerage_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Baron_Moran","/wiki/John_Wilson,_2nd_Baron_Moran","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/40182010","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran&oldid=561591966","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1882_births","/wiki/Category:1977_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Skipton","/wiki/Category:Barons_in_the_Peerage_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Royal_Army_Medical_Corps_officers","/wiki/Category:Knights_Bachelor","/wiki/Category:British_Army_personnel_of_World_War_I","/wiki/Category:Recipients_of_the_Military_Cross","/wiki/Category:20th-century_English_medical_doctors","/wiki/Category:Fellows_of_the_Royal_College_of_Physicians","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Pocklington_School","/wiki/Category:Presidents_of_the_Royal_College_of_Physicians","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_September_2010","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Charles+Wilson%2C+1st+Baron+Moran&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Charles+Wilson%2C+1st+Baron+Moran","/wiki/Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran","/wiki/Talk:Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran","#","/wiki/Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Moran&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/He
