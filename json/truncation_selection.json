Truncation selection is less sophisticated than many\nother selection methods, and is not often used in practice. It is used in\nMuhlenbein's Breeder Genetic Algorithm. {{cite journal| journal=Evolutionary\nComputation| year=1993| title=Predictive Models for the Breeder Genetic\nAlgorithm| author=H Muhlenbein, D Schlierkamp-Voosen| url=http://citeseer.comp.-\nnus.edu.sg/rd/0,730860,1,0.25,Download/http:qSqqSqwww.ais.fraunhofer.deqSq%257E-\nmuehlenqSqpublicationsqSqgmd_as_ga-93_01.ps}}\n","linknr":-1,"url":"truncation_selection","recorded":1376428022,"links":[],"instances":["genetic_algorithm"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetic algorithms"],"headings":["References"],"image":[],"tags":[["selection","genetic_algorithm"]],"members":["selection"],"related":["Selection_(genetic_algorithm)","Genetic_algorithm","Breeder_Genetic_Algorithm"]}
