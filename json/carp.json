{"cursor":"23548","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, Cyprinus carpio ]]\n\n'Carp' are various species of oily freshwater fish of the family\nCyprinidae, a very large group of fish native to Europe and Asia.\n\nThe cypriniformes (family Cyprinidae) are traditionally grouped with the\nCharaciformes, Siluriformes and Gymnotiformes to create the superorder\nOstariophysi, since these groups have certain common features, such as being\nfound predominantly in fresh water and that they possess Weberian ossicles (an\nanatomical structure originally made up of small pieces of bone formed from\nfour or five of the first vertebrae); the most anterior bony pair is in contact\nwith the extension of the labyrinth and the posterior with the swimbladder. The\nfunction is poorly understood, but this structure is presumed to take part in\nthe transmission of vibrations from the swimbladder to the labyrinth and in the\nperception of sound, which would explain why the Ostariophysi have such a great\ncapacity for hearing. Billard R. (Ed.) (1995). Carp â\nBiology and Culture. Springer-Praxis Series in Aquaculture and Fisheries,\nChichester, UK.\n\nMost cypriniformes have scales and teeth on the inferior pharyngeal bones which\nmay be modified in relation to the diet. [[Tribolodon]] is the only cyprinid\ngenus which tolerates salt water, although there are several species which move\ninto brackish water, but return to fresh water to spawn. All of the other\ncypriniformes live in continental waters and have a wide geographical range. Some consider all cyprinid fishes carp, and the family\nCyprinidae itself is often known as the carp family. In colloquial use, carp\nusually refers only to several larger cyprinid species such as [[Cyprinus\ncarpio]] (common carp), [[Carassius carassius]] (Crucian carp),\n[[Ctenopharyngodon idella]] (grass carp), [[Hypophthalmichthys molitrix]]\n(silver carp), and [[Hypophthalmichthys nobilis]] (bighead carp). Carp have long\nbeen an important food fish to humans, as well as popular ornamental fishes such\nas the various goldfish breeds and the domesticated common carp variety known as\nkoi. As a result, carp have been introduced to various locations, though with\nmixed results. Several species of carp are listed as invasive species by the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, and worldwide large sums of money are\nspent on carp control.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"carp","recorded":1376427955,"links":[],"instances":["dish"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Carp|","Commercial fish","Edible fish","Fishkeeping","Fish of Europe","Fish of East Asia","Fish of Southeast Asia","Invasive fish species","Oily fish","Sport fish"],"headings":["Species","Recreational fishing","Aquaculture","Breeding","As food","As ornamental fish","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["kuai","dish"]],"members":["kuai"],"related":["Oily_fish","Freshwater_fish","Cyprinidae","Characiformes","Siluriformes","Gymnotiformes","Ostariophysi","Weberian_ossicles","Swimbladder","Goldfish","Koi","Trophic_level","FishBase","FAO","ITIS","IUCN","Silver_carp","Common_carp","Grass_carp","Bighead_carp","Crucian_carp","Catla","Mrigal","Black_carp","Mud_Carp","Mirror_carp","Izaak_Walton","Angling","Coarse_fish","Rough_fish","Domesticated","Fish_farming","Food_fish","Eurasia","Fan_Li","Fish_pond","Common_carp","Asian_carp","East_Asia","South_Asia","Catla","Rohu","Indian_carp","Western_Europe","Trout","Salmon","Russian_Federation","Tuna","Black_carp","Grass_carp","Silver_carp","Bighead_carp","Black_carp","Grass_carp","Silver_carp","Bighead_carp","Animal_husbandry","Chinese_Academy_of_Fishery_Sciences","Common_carp","Feed_conversion_rate","Fish_fillet","Bighead_carp","Louisiana_State_University","Crucian_carp","Borscht","Mud_carp","Chinese_mud_carp","Guangdong_Province","Taiwan","Cantonese_cuisine","Shunde","Fish_balls","Dumplings","Chinese_cabbage","Fisherman's_soup","Kuai_(dish)","Taramosalata","Masgouf","Iraqi_cuisine","Sundanese_people","Pla_som","Oranda","Pearlscale","Cyprinid","Goldfish","Koi","Japan","China","Europe","Common_carp","Oily_fish","Rough_fish"]}
