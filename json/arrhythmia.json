The heartbeat may be too fast or too slow,\nand may be regular or irregular. A heart beat that is too fast is called\ntachycardia and a heart beat that is too slow is called bradycardia. Although\nmany arrhythmias are not life-threatening, some can cause cardiac arrest.\n\nArrhythmias can occur in the upper chambers of the heart, (atria), or in the\nlower chambers of the heart, (ventricles). Arrhythmias may occur at any age.\nSome are barely perceptible, whereas others can be more dramatic and can even\nlead to sudden cardiac death. www.arrhythmiaaliiance.org.uk\n\nSome arrhythmias are life-threatening medical emergencies and can result in\ncardiac arrest. Cardiac arrythmias are one of the most common causes of death\nwhen travelling to a hospital. Others cause symptoms such as an abnormal\nawareness of heart beat (palpitations) and may be merely uncomfortable. These\npalpitations have also been known to be caused by atrial/ventricular\nfibrillation, wire faults, and other technical or mechanical issues in cardiac\npacemakers/defibrillators. Still others may not be associated with any symptoms\nat all, but may predispose the patient to potentially life threatening stroke\nor embolism.\n\nThe term sinus arrhythmia refers to a normal phenomenon of mild acceleration and\nslowing of the heart rate that occurs with breathing in and out. It is usually\nquite pronounced in children and steadily decreases with age. This can also be\npresent during meditation breathing exercises that involve deep inhaling and\nbreath holding patterns. Proarrhythmia is a new or more frequent occurrence of\npre-existing arrhythmias, paradoxically precipitated by antiarrhythmic therapy,\nwhich means it is a side effect associated with the administration of some\nexisting antiarrhythmic drugs, as well as drugs for other indications. In other\nwords, it is a tendency of antiarrhythmic drugs to facilitate emergence of new\narrhythmias. Some arrhythmias are minor and can be regarded as normal variants.\nIn fact, most people will on occasion feel their heart skip a beat or give an\noccasional extra strong beat; neither of these is usually a cause for\nalarm.
