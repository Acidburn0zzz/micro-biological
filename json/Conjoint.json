It is now no longer awarded. The\nConjoint Board was superseded in 1994 by the United Examining Board, which lost\nits permission to hold qualifying medical examinations after 1999.\n\nMedical education at the London Teaching Hospitals began some centuries before\nthere was a university in London to award medical degrees. Those who had taken\nBAs at Oxford or Cambridge, or occasionally started their pre-clinical education\nat universities further afield, could return there to take medical examinations,\nbut it was open to most to take the examinations of the London medical\ncorporations.\n\nAs the early 19th century law restricting medical employment in the British\nmilitary to those who had qualifications in both medicine and surgery was taken\nto require diplomas from different organisations, it became customary to take\nboth the Licence of the Society of Apothecaries (LSA) and the Membership of the\nRoyal College of Surgeons of England (MRCS).\n\nThese corporations diverged: the Society of Apothecaries added surgery to their\nexamination, to grant a Licence in Medicine and Surgery (LMSSA) as a complete\nqualification. The surgeons then teamed up with the Royal College of Physicians\nof London who paired their Licentiate diploma (LRCP) with the MRCS to create the\nEnglish Conjoint Diploma in 1884.\n\nThe London LRCP had previously been a means for bachelors or licentiates in\nmedicine from Oxford and Cambridge (and a few MDs from elsewhere) to qualify to\npractice in London as physicians (i.e. internal medicine specialists, as\ndistinct from surgeons or apothecaries). The old LRCP also allowed the holder by\ncustom to be addressed as \"doctor\" without holding a university doctorate: this\nprivilege became generalised in the 19th century to all licentiates and\nbachelors of medicine.\n\nThe nomenclature of the diplomas may have contributed to the nearly-obsolete\npractice of general practitioners styling themselves as \"Physician and Surgeon\":\npreviously they were mostly regarded as Apothecaries.\n\n(There were also Scottish and Irish conjoint qualifications: the former became\nknown as the Triple Qualification.)\n\nIn the 19th century the new University of London Bachelor of Medicine and\nBachelor of Surgery degrees were regarded as more academic than the Royal\nColleges' diplomas, so many people qualified and started practice with the\nConjoint before taking the M.B. and B.S. a year or two later. This paralleled\nthe practice in some European countries of taking a state medical examination\nseparately from or instead of a university degree. In the English provincial\ncities, some medical schools developed separately from the new Redbrick\nuniversities, so the Conjoint diplomas were at first usually taken.\n\nArmed forces officer cadets would be promoted from second lieutenant to\nlieutenant on qualifying, which included the conjoint qualification. The\ndifference in pay between the times of the two exams would more than pay for the\nentry fee, and also seniority in the officer corps would be enhanced by those\nfew months.\n\nThe conjoint diploma of the London Royal Colleges (Royal College of Surgeons of\nEngland and Royal College of Physicians of London) was more reputable in its\nday, but after World War II it was regarded as a practice exam before university\nfinals. It provided a safety net, in that medical students unsure whether they\nwould pass or fail would have two chances if they took both.\n\nBy far the greatest use of the Conjoint and similar qualifications in recent\nyears was as a means for foreign medical graduates to obtain British\nqualifications, which eased their problems of obtaining registration and\nemployment in the U.K., and also made it easier to go on to work in third\ncountries.\n\nThe scheme of examinations included a notional full set of pre-clinical subjects\n(anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, pathology, etc.) from which those who had\nuniversity passes or another final medical qualification would be exempted: but\nfees might still have to be paid.\n\nThe closure of this portal, along with the recent recategorisation of junior\ndoctors from student to worker status for immigration purposes, may hasten the\nchangeover of the National Health Service's dependence from Third World medical\ngraduates to European Union doctors, who may not be asked to submit to further\nexamination.\n\nThese subtleties of the British system of medical qualifications were rarely\nknown to patients, who may have been more impressed to see \"MB BS MRCS LRCP\" on\na brass plate than \"MD FRCP\"\n","linknr":114,"url":"Conjoint","recorded":1376429212,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Conjoint&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Conjoint&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjoint","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conjoint&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Conjoined_twins","/wiki/Conjoint_analysis","/wiki/Conjoint_tendon","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/United_Examining_Board","/wiki/United_Examining_Board","/wiki/London","/wiki/Teaching_Hospital","/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts","/wiki/University_of_Oxford","/wiki/University_of_Cambridge","/wiki/Society_of_Apothecaries","/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_England","/wiki/Society_of_Apothecaries","/w/index.php?title=LMSSA&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Royal_College_of_Physicians_of_London","/wiki/LRCP","/wiki/Apothecaries","/w/index.php?title=Triple_Qualification&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/University_of_London","/wiki/Redbrick","/wiki/Military_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Officer_cadet","/wiki/Second_lieutenant","/wiki/Lieutenant","/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_England","/wiki/Royal_College_of_Physicians_of_London","/wiki/University","/wiki/Medical_student","/wiki/National_Health_Service","/wiki/Third_World","/wiki/European_Union","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conjoint&oldid=566908615","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Academic_degrees_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Medical_education_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Medical_degrees","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Conjoint&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Conjoint","/wiki/Conjoint","/wiki/Talk:Conjoint","#","/wiki/Conjoint","/w/index.php?title=Conjoint&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Conjoint&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Conjoint&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Conjoint","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Conjoint","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Conjoint&oldid=566908615","/w/index.php?title=Conjoint&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5161134","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Conjoint&id=566908615","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Conjoint","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Conjoint&oldid=566908615&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Conjoint&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5161134#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjoint","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/powered
