The lifespan of a wild night monkey is unknown; however, they have a\nlifespan of 20 years in captivity. The total population of night monkeys is\nsimilarly unknown, as the monkeys live near the canopies of deciduous forests,\nmaking counting the monkeys very difficult. Night monkeys constitute one of the\nfew monkey species that are affected by the often deadly human malaria protozoan\n[[Plasmodium falciparum]], making them useful as non-human primate experimental\nmodels in malaria research.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"night_monkey","recorded":1376418367,"links":[],"instances":["animal","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Night monkeys"],"headings":["Taxonomy","Physical characteristics","Ecology","Behavior","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["family","biology"],["territory","animal"]],"members":["territory","family"],"related":["Animal","Chordate","Mammal","Primate","Haplorrhini","Simiiformes","Platyrrhini","Poche","Johann_Karl_Wilhelm_Illiger","Alexander_von_Humboldt","Species","Genus","New_World_monkey","Family_(biology)","Malaria","Protozoan","Junior_synonym","Junior_synonym","Chromosomes","Fossil","Extant_taxon","Gray-bellied_night_monkey","Panamanian_night_monkey","Gray-handed_night_monkey","Hern√°ndez-Camacho's_night_monkey","Brumback's_night_monkey","Three-striped_night_monkey","Spix's_night_monkey","Azara's_night_monkey","Peruvian_night_monkey","Nancy_Ma's_night_monkey","Black-headed_night_monkey","Azara's_night_monkey","Brumback's_night_monkey","Panama","Colombia","Ecuador","Peru","Brazil","Paraguay","Argentina","Bolivia","Primary_forest","Secondary_forest","Nocturnal","Cathemeral","Monochromat","Territory_(animal)","Scent_marking","Pair_bond"]}
