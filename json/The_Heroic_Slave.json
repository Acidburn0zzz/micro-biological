{"cursor":"4029","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'The Heroic Slave, a heartwarming Narrative of the Adventures of Madison\nWashington, in Pursuit of Liberty' is a short piece of fiction written by famous\nabolitionist Frederick Douglass. When the Rochester Ladies' Anti Slavery Society\nasked Douglass for a short story to go in their collection, Autographs for\nFreedom, Douglass responded with The Heroic Slave. The novella, published in\n1852 by John P. Jewett and Company, was Douglass' first and only published work\nof fiction (though he did publish several autobiographical narratives).\n\nThe Heroic Slave is a fictional work inspired by Madison Washington, an enslaved\ncook on the brig Creole, who led a rebellion on the ship by 19 slaves in\nNovember 1841. They succeeded in taking control of the ship en route from\nVirginia to New Orleans, and ordered it sailed to Nassau in the Bahamas. A total\nof 128 slaves gained freedom there as Britain had abolished slavery in 1839.\n\nPart I opens as Madison Washington carries a heavy load through the woods,\nlamenting his condition under slavery. Mr. Listwell, a free white man, secretly\nwatches him in silence.\n\nIn Part II, the story moves ahead five years. Mr. Listwell is sitting at the\ntable with his wife when they hear a knock at the door. Madison Washington is\nrunning from slavery, and Mr. Listwell is more than willing to help him escape.\nAs they talk, Mr. Listwell tells Madison he remembers him from so many years\nbefore, and asks him where he has been all of this time. Madison reveals that on\nthe day Mr. Listwell saw him, he left his wife and children to escape and seek\nfreedom. Unable to find his way to the North, a week later he returned to his\nplantation. He met with his wife who regularly gave him food and provision, and\nfor five years hid in the woods. However, a great fire caused Madison to lose\nhis hiding place, which is why he ran to see Mr. Listwell. Mr. Listwell gives\nMadison a new coat and provisions and helps him escape to Canada.\n\nIn Part III, Mr. Listwell is in a tavern and reveals that he has traveled 40\nmiles that day. As he drinks, he sees a slave-gang on their way to market, and\nis surprised to see Madison Washington among the slaves. Madison reveals that he\nreached Canada, but he missed his wife so much that he returned to the United\nStates to help her escape. He reached her bedroom window, but he scared her so\nmuch that he woke up her master. The couple were chased by the master and his\ndogs. His wife was shot down and killed, and he had been sold to traders who\nwould take him to the Deep South. Mr. Listwell realizes there's nothing he can\ndo for Madison in these conditions, but implores the man to put his trust in\nGod. As he is leaving, Mr. Listwell buys 3 files; he gives them and $10 secretly\nto Madison. Part III ends with Madison taken aboard a ship and sailing to the\nSouth for re-sale.\n\nIn Part IV, men speak about \"unfortunate\" events that occurred aboard the ship\n[[Creole case|Creole]]. Madison Washington gained the trust of all of the\noverseers on board and, using the files Mr. Listwell had given him, cuts\nthrough his fetters and leads the slaves in rebellion. Nineteen slaves survived\nthe battle. Madison declared himself captain of the ship, which sailed to\nNassau. It was located in the British colony of the Bahamas, and Britain had\nabolished slavery in 1839. In Nassau, a group of black soldiers declared that\nthey only protected property, and people were not property, so the nineteen\nslaves became free.\n","linknr":182,"url":"The_Heroic_Slave","recorded":1376418620,"links":["/w/index.php?title=The_Heroic_Slave&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Heroic_Slave&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heroic_Slave","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources","/wiki/Talk:The_Heroic_Slave#.23","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Heroic_Slave&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Heroic_Slave&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Independent_sources","/wiki/Frederick_Douglass","/wiki/John_P._Jewett","/wiki/Madison_Washington","/wiki/Creole_case","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Creole_case","/w/index.php?title=The_Heroic_Slave&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=The_Heroic_Slave&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Template:Slave_narrative","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Slave_narrative&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Slave_narrative&action=edit","/wiki/Slave_narrative","/wiki/Slave_Narrative_Collection","/wiki/Captivity_narrative","/wiki/Robert_Adams_(sailor)","/wiki/Francis_Bok","/wiki/James_Leander_Cathcart","/wiki/Thomas_Pellow","/wiki/Juan_Francisco_Manzano","/wiki/Pierre_Toussaint","/wiki/Olaudah_Equiano","/wiki/Ukawsaw_Gronniosaw","/wiki/Marie-Joseph_Ang%C3%A9lique","/wiki/Sam_Aleckson","/wiki/William_J._Anderson","/wiki/Jared_Maurice_Arter","/wiki/Polly_Berry","/wiki/Henry_Bibb","/wiki/Leonard_Black","/wiki/John_Brown_(fugitive_slave)","/wiki/William_Wells_Brown","/wiki/Peter_Bruner","/wiki/Ellen_and_William_Craft","/wiki/Hannah_Crafts","/wiki/Lucinda_Davis","/wiki/Noah_Davis","/wiki/Lucy_Delaney","/wiki/Ayuba_Suleiman_Diallo","/wiki/Frederick_Douglass","/wiki/Kate_Drumgoold","/wiki/Jordan_Winston_Early","/wiki/Sarah_Jane_Woodson_Early","/wiki/David_George_(Baptist)","/wiki/Moses_Grandy","/wiki/William_Green_(former_slave)","/wiki/Maryland","/wiki/Josiah_Henson","/wiki/John_Andrew_Jackson","/wiki/Harriet_Ann_Jacobs","/wiki/Thomas_James_(minister)","/wiki/Fountain_Hughes","/wiki/Boston_King","/wiki/Lunsford_Lane","/wiki/J._Vance_Lewis","/wiki/Solomon_Northup","/wiki/John_Parker_(abolitionist)","/wiki/William_Parker_(abolitionist)","/wiki/Mary_Prince","/wiki/James_Roberts_(slave_narrative)","/wiki/Moses_Roper","/wiki/Omar_Ibn_Said","/wiki/William_Henry_Singleton","/wiki/Venture_Smith","/wiki/Austin_Steward","/wiki/Pierre_Toussaint","/wiki/Harriet_Tubman","/wiki/Wallace_Turnage","/wiki/Bethany_Veney","/wiki/Booker_T._Washington","/wiki/Wallace_Willis","/wiki/Harriet_E._Wilson","/wiki/Zamba_Zembola","/wiki/Treatment_of_slaves_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Exodus_narrative_in_Antebellum_America","/wiki/Slavery_among_the_indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","/wiki/The_Slave_Community","/wiki/Beloved_(novel)","/wiki/The_Bondwoman%27s_Narrative","/wiki/Clotel","/wiki/Confessions_of_Nat_Turner","/wiki/Dessa_Rose","/wiki/Jubilee_(novel)","/wiki/Kindred_(novel)","/wiki/The_Known_World","/wiki/Unburnable","/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin","/wiki/Walk_Through_Darkness","/wiki/To_a_Southern_Slaveholder","/wiki/African-American_literature","/wiki/Caribbean_literature","/wiki/Frederick_Douglass_and_the_White_Negro","/wiki/Unchained_Memories","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Heroic_Slave&oldid=555224900","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Works_by_Frederick_Douglass","/wiki/Category:1852_books","/wiki/Category:American_historical_fiction","/wiki/Category:Fictional_versions_of_real_people","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_January_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_reliabl
