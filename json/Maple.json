Modern\nclassifications, including the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system, favour\ninclusion in Sapindaceae. The type species of the genus is [[Acer\npseudoplatanus]] (Sycamore maple). van Gelderen, C. J. & van\nGelderen, D. M. (1999). Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia\n\nThere are approximately 128 species, most of which are native to\nAsia, with a number also appearing in Europe, northern Africa, and\nNorth America. Only one species, the poorly studied [[Acer laurinum]], is native\nto the Southern Hemisphere. Gibbs, D. & Chen,\nY. (2009) [http://www.bgci.org/files/Worldwide/News/sepdec09/maples_red_list.pdf\nThe Red List of Maples] Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) ISBN\n978-1-905164-31-8 Fifty-four species of maples meet the International\nUnion for Conservation of Nature criteria for being under threat of extinction\nin their native habitat.\n\nThe word Acer derives from a Latin word meaning \"sharp\" (compare \"acerbic\"),\nreferring to the characteristic points on maple leaves. It was first applied\nto the genus by the French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in 1700. The\nearliest known fossil maple is [[Acer alaskense]], from the Latest Paleocene\nof Alaska.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Maple","recorded":1376428765,"links":[],"instances":["drinking_vessel","botany","plants","cooking","botany","fruit","plant","botany","season","plant","tree"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Acer|","Plants with indehiscent fruit"],"headings":["Morphology","Pests and diseases","Cultural significance","Uses","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["trunk","botany"],["symmetry","biology#pentamerism"],["ovary","plants"],["spring","season"],["nectar","plant"],["samara","fruit"],["stratification","botany"],["ramification","botany"],["smoking","cooking"],["sap","plant"],["ash","tree"],["mazer","drinking_vessel"]],"members":["mazer","trunk","ovary","smoking","ramification","samara","nectar","stratification","symmetry","spring","sap","ash"],"related":["Plantae","Angiosperms","Eudicots","Rosids","Sapindales","Sapindaceae","Aceraceae","Hippocastanoideae","Carolus_Linnaeus","List_of_Acer_species","Genus","Tree","Shrub","Aceraceae","Hippocastanaceae","Sapindaceae","Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group","Type_species","Species","Asia","Europe","Africa","North_America","International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature","Latin_language","Maple_leaf","French_people","Joseph_Pitton_de_Tournefort","Late_Paleocene","Tree","Shrub","Trunk_(botany)","Deciduous","Mediterranean_region","Evergreen","Shade_tolerance","Sugar_Maple","Root","Root_sprout","Clonal_colony","Leaf","Leaf_shape","Leaf_shape","Flower","Raceme","Corymb","Umbels","Sepal","Petal","Stamen","Pistil","Ovary_(plants)","Carpel","Winter","Spring_(season)","Pollen","Nectar_(plant)","Bee","Computed_tomography","Voxel","Fruit","Samara_(fruit)","Seed","Biological_dispersal","Stratification_(botany)","Germination","Acer_pseudoplatanus","Larva","Lepidoptera","List_of_Lepidoptera_that_feed_on_maples","Aphid","Asian_Longhorned_Beetle","Fungus","Drought","Root_rot","Mildew","Maple_leaf","Canada","Canadian_flag","Canadian_Forces","Ornamental_tree","Norway_Maple","Silver_Maple","Japanese_Maple","Red_Maple","Cultivar","Plant_propagation","Asexual_reproduction","Tissue_culture","Grafting","Western_world","Bonsai","Japanese_maple","Trident_maple","Amur_maple","Field_maple","Montpellier_maple","Ramification_(botany)","Arboretum","England","Wakehurst_Place_Garden","Westonbirt_Arboretum","Windsor_Great_Park","Winkworth_Arboretum","Wisley_Garden","United_States","Harvard_University","Arnold_Arboretum","Boston,_Massachusetts","Esveld_Aceretum","Boskoop","Autumn_foliage","Japan","Momijigari","Nikko,_Tochigi","Kyoto","Seoraksan","Naejang-san","Leaf_peeping","North_America","Central_Ontario","Quebec","Vermont","New_Hampshire","Western_Massachusetts","Smoking_(cooking)","Lincoln_County_Process","Tennessee_Whiskey","Ornamental_plant","Tourism","Agriculture","Sugar_maple","Sap_(plant)","Maple_syrup","Maple_sugar","Maple_taffy","Timber","Bowling","Cue_stick","Butcher_block","Baseball_bat","Ash_(tree)","Hickory","Recurve_bow","Wood_grain","Flame_maple","Quilt_maple","Birdseye_maple","Burl","Tonewood","Musical_instrument","Mahogany","Violins","Violas","Cellos","Double_bass","Electric_guitar","Stratocaster","Telecaster","Rosewood","Gibson_Guitar_Corporation","Les_Paul","Solid_body","Bassoon","Woodwind_instrument","Drum","Birch","Pollen","Honeybee","Pulpwood","Paper","Autumn","Mazer_(drinking_vessel)"]}
