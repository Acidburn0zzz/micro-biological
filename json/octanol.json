It is a fatty alcohol.\nMany other isomers are also known. Esters of octanol, such as octyl acetate,\noccur as components of essential oils. Octanol is manufactured for the synthesis\nof esters for use in perfumes and flavorings. It is used to model the\npartitioning of pharmaceutical products between water and the cytosol.
