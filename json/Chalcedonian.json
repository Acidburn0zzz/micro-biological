{"cursor":"4379","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Chalcedonian' describes churches and theologians which accept the definition\ngiven at the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD) of how the divine and human relate in\nthe person of Jesus Christ. While most modern Christian churches are\nChalcedonian, in the 5thâ8th centuries AD the ascendancy of Chalcedonian\nChristology was not always certain. The dogmatical disputes raised during this\nSynod led to the Chalcedonian schism and as a matter of course to the formation\nof the non-Chalcedonian body of churches known as Oriental Orthodoxy. The\nChalcedonian churches were the ones that remained united with Rome,\nConstantinople and the three Greek Orthodox patriarchates of the East\n(Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem), that under Justinian II at the council in\nTrullo were organised under a form of rule known as the Pentarchy.\n\nThe majority of the Armenian, Syrian, Coptic, and Ethiopian Christians rejected\nthe Chalcedonian definition, and are now known collectively as the Oriental\nOrthodox churches. But, some Armenian Christians (especially in the region of\nCappadocia and Trebizond inside the Byzantine Empire) did accept the decisions\nof the Council of Chalcedon and engaged in polemics against the Armenian\nApostolic Church. Churches of the Syriac tradition among the Eastern\nCatholic Churches are also Chalcedonian. The Georgians though were Eastern\nOrthodox and accepted this dogma.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Chalcedonian","recorded":1376429130,"links":[],"instances":["philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Christology","God in Christianity","Christian terms","Chalcedonianism|"],"headings":["The Chalcedonian and the Non-Chalcedonian definition","Dissent from the Chalcedonian view","References and notes","See also"],"image":[],"tags":[["hypostasis","philosophy"]],"members":["hypostasis"],"related":["Council_of_Chalcedon","Jesus_Christ","Christology","Non-Chalcedonian","Oriental_Orthodoxy","Holy_See","Ecumenical_Patriarchate","Greek_Orthodox","Justinian_II","Council_in_Trullo","Pentarchy","Oriental_Orthodoxy","Armenians","Cappadocia","Trebizond","Byzantine_Empire","Armenian_Apostolic_Church","Eastern_Catholic_Church","Georgians","Eastern_Orthodox_Church","Jesus_of_Nazareth","Physis","Hypostasis_(philosophy)","Miaphysitism","Monophysitism","Eutychianism","Monophysites","Nestorianism","Trinitarianism","Hypostatic_union","Arianism","Modalism","Ebionites","Heresies","First_Council_of_Nicaea","Christological","Nestorianism","Eutyches","Monophysite","Monothelitism","Monergism","St_Cyril","Dyophysitism","Nestorianism","Chalcedonian_Creed","Christology","Council_of_Chalcedon","Hypostatic_union","Miaphysitism","Monophysitism","Anastasius_Sinaita"]}
