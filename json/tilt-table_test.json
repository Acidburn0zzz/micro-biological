Patients with symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness,\nwith or without a loss of consciousness (fainting), suspected to be associated\nwith a drop in blood pressure or positional tachycardia are good candidates for\nthis test.\n\nThe procedure tests for causes of syncope by attempting to cause syncope by\nhaving the patient lie flat on a special table or bed while connected to ECG and\nblood pressure monitors. The table then creates a change in posture from lying\nto standing.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"tilt-table_test","recorded":1376428637,"links":[],"instances":["angle","pharmacology","medical","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Physical examination"],"headings":["Preparations","Procedure","Diagnostic symptoms","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["syncope","medicine"],["degree","angle"],["glyceryl_trinitrate","pharmacology"],["collapse","medical"]],"members":["degree","glyceryl_trinitrate","collapse","syncope"],"related":["Medical_procedure","Diagnosis","Dysautonomia","Syncope_(medicine)","Patient","Symptom","Consciousness","Fainting","Blood_pressure","Tachycardia","Fasting","Intravenous_line","Medications","Transcranial_Doppler","Degree_(angle)","Glyceryl_trinitrate_(pharmacology)","Isoproterenol","Cardiac_arrhythmia","Blood_vessels","Blood","Pink","Red","Collapse_(medical)","Seizures","Asystole","Atropine","Phenylephrine","Ephedrine","Dixâ€“Hallpike_test"]}
