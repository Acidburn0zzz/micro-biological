(In some\ncountries, bananas used for cooking may be called plantains.) The fruit is\nvariable in size, color and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with\nsoft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind which may be yellow, purple or red\nwhen ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost\nall modern edible parthenocarpic (seedless) bananas come from two wild species â\n[[Musa acuminata]] and [[Musa balbisiana]]. The scientific names of most\ncultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa Ã paradisiaca\nfor the hybrid Musa acuminata Ã M. balbisiana, depending on their genomic\nconstitution. The old scientific name Musa sapientum is no longer used.\n\nMusa species are native to tropical South and Southeast Asia, and are likely to\nhave been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea. They\nare grown in at least 107 countries, primarily for their\nfruit, and to a lesser extent to make fiber, banana wine and as ornamental\nplants. In 2013 bananas were fourth among the main world food crops (after rice,\nwheat and maize) in financial value. [Holmes, Bob (20 April\n2013) \"Go Bananas\", New Scientist, Volume 218, Number 2913, Pages 39-41. This\narticle, with a different heading \"Nana from heaven? How our favourite fruit\ncame to be\", is also available on the Internet with a subscription at [http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21829132.000-nana-from-heaven-how-our-\nfavourite-fruit-came-to-be.html], Retrieved 19 April. 2013\n\nWorldwide, there is no sharp distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\".\nEspecially in the Americas and Europe, \"banana\" usually refers to soft, sweet,\ndessert bananas, particularly those of the Cavendish group, which are the main\nexports from banana-growing countries. By contrast, ''Musa'' cultivars with\nfirmer, starchier fruit are called \"plantains\". In other regions, such as\nSoutheast Asia, many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the simple two-\nfold distinction is not useful and is not made in local languages.\n\nThe term \"banana\" is also used as the common name for the plants which produce\nthe fruit. This can extend to other members of the genus Musa like\nthe scarlet banana (Musa coccinea), pink banana (Musa velutina) and the Fe'i\nbananas. It can also refer to members of the genus [[Ensete]], like the snow\nbanana (Ensete glaucum) and the economically important false banana (Ensete\nventricosum). Both genera are classified under the banana family, Musaceae.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"banana","recorded":1376418441,"links":[],"instances":["spirit","plants","folklore","travel","biology","botany","true","taxonomy","chemistry","fruit","botany"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bananas|","Fiber
