It is based upon the\nsyntactic combination of lexicals and names that are drawn from very large\n(usually about 10,000 different words) vocabularies. Each spoken word is created\nout of the phonetic combination of a limited set of vowel and consonant speech\nsound units. These vocabularies, the syntax which structures them, and their set\nof speech sound units differ, creating the existence of many thousands of\ndifferent types of mutually unintelligible human languages. Most human speakers\nare able to communicate in two or more of them,  hence\nbeing polyglots. The vocal abilities that enable humans to produce speech also\nprovide humans with the ability to sing.\n\nA gestural form of human communication exists for the deaf in the form of sign\nlanguage. Speech in some cultures has become the basis of a written language,\noften one that differs in its vocabulary, syntax and phonetics from its\nassociated spoken one, a situation called diglossia. Speech in addition to its\nuse in communication, it is suggested by some psychologists such as Vygotsky is\ninternally used by mental processes to enhance and organize cognition in the\nform of an interior monologue.\n\nSpeech is researched in terms of the speech production and speech perception of\nthe sounds used in vocal language. Other research topics concern speech\nrepetition, the ability to map heard spoken words into the vocalizations needed\nto recreated that plays a key role in the vocabulary expansion in children and\nspeech errors. Several academic disciplines study these including acoustics,\npsychology, speech pathology, linguistics, cognitive science, communication\nstudies, otolaryngology and computer science. Another area of research is how\nthe human brain in its different areas such as the Broca's area and Wernicke's\narea underlies speech.\n\nIt is controversial how far human speech is unique in that other animals also\ncommunicate with vocalizations. While none in the wild have compatibly large\nvocabularies, research upon the nonverbal abilities of language trained apes\nsuch as Washoe and Kanzi raises the possibility that they might have these\ncapabilities. The origins of speech are unknown and subject to much debate and\nspeculation.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Speech","recorded":1376429148,"links":[],"instances":["chimpanzee","speech","psychology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Oral communication","Language","Speech|"],"headings":["Production","Perception","Repetition","Errors","Problems involving speech","Brain physiology","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["stream_of_consciousness","psychology"],["washoe","chimpanzee"],["lisp","speech"]],"members":["washoe","lisp","stream_of_consciousness"],"related":["Human","Syntactic","Lexicon","Name","Words","Vocabulary","Phonetic","Vowel","Consonant","Mutual_intelligibility","Language","Multilingualism","Singing","Deaf","Sign_language","Culture","Written_language","Diglossia","Psychologist","Vygotsky","Cognition","Stream_of_consciousness_(psychology)","Speech_perception","Sounds","Vocal_language","Speech_repetition","Vocabulary","Children","Speech_error","Acoustics","Psychology","Speech_pathology","Linguistics","Cognitive_science","Communication_studies","Otolaryngology","Computer_science","Human_brain","Broca's_area","Wernicke's_area","Human","Animal_language","Wildness","Apes","Washoe_(chimpanzee)","Kanzi","Origin_of_language","Speculation","Linguistics","Articulatory_phonetics","Consonant","Place_of_articulation","Homorganic","Lung","Phonation","Glottis","Larynx","Vocal_tract","Vowel","Consonant","Alaryngeal_speech","Esophageal_speech","Donald_Duck_talk","Spoken_language","Working_memory_","Lung","Vocal_cords","Paralysis","Vocal_fold_nodules","Cancer","Brain","Alogia","Aphasia","Dysarthria","Dystonia","Speech_processing","Otitis_media","Auditory_processing_disorder","Relaxed_pronunciation","Stuttering","Lisp_(speech)","Cleft_palate","Ataxia","Nerve","Manner_of_articulation","Tourette_syndrome","Tic","Dysphasia","Anomic_aphasia","Auditory_processing_disorder","Deafness","Paul_Broca","Carl_Wernicke","Communibiology","Imagined_speech","Index_of_linguistics_articles","Spatial_hearing_loss","Speechwriter","Talking_bird","Vocology","YouTube"]}
