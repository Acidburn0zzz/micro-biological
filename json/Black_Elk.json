He was Heyoka and a second cousin of\nCrazy Horse.\n\nBlack Elk was born in December 1863 along the Little Powder River (thought to be\nin the present-day state of Wyoming). According to the Lakota way of\nmeasuring time, (referred to as Winter counts) Black Elk was born \"the Winter\nWhen the Four Crows Were Killed on Tongue River\". The Sixth Grandfather:\nBlack Elk's Teachings Given to John G. Neihardt, edited by Raymond J. DeMallie;\n1985 page. 101 While in his early 40s in 1904, Black Elk was\nchristened with the first name of Nicholas after becoming Catholic. When other\nmedicine men would speak of him, such as his nephew Fools Crow, they would refer\nto him both as Black Elk and Nicholas Black Elk; see example in book, Fools\nCrow, by Thomas E. Mails, p. 44.\n\nWhen Black Elk was nine years old, he was suddenly taken ill and left prone and\nunresponsive for several days. During this time he had a great vision in which\nhe was visited by the Thunder Beings (Wakinyan), and taken to the Grandfathers â\nspiritual representatives of the six sacred directions: west, east, north,\nsouth, above, and below. These \"...spirits were represented as kind and loving,\nfull of years and wisdom, like revered human grandfathers.\" When he was seventeen, Black Elk told a medicine man, Black Road, about\nthe vision in detail. Black Road and the other medicine men of the village were\n\"astonished by the greatness of the vision\"\n\nBlack Elk had learned many things in his vision to help heal his people. He had\ncome from a line long of medicine men and healers in his family; his father was\na medicine man as were his paternal uncles. Late in his life as an elder, he\nrelated to John Neihardt the vision that occurred to him in which among other\nthings he saw a great tree that symbolized the life of the earth and all\npeople. Neihardt, John, ed., Black Elk Speaks, annotated edition, published\nby SUNY, 2008, p. 33. Neihardt recorded all of it in minute detail, and\nconsequently it is preserved in various books today.\n\nIn his vision, Black Elk is taken to the center of the earth, and to the central\nmountain of the world. What mythologist Joseph Campbell explained as \"the axis\nmundi, the central point, the pole around which all revolves...the point where\nstillness and movement are together...\" Black Elk was residing at the axis of\nthe six sacred directions. Campbell viewed Black Elk's statement as key to\nunderstanding myth and symbols.\n\nAs Black Elk related: {{Blockquote| And while I stood there I saw more than I\ncan tell and understood more than I saw; for I was seeing in a sacred manner the\nshapes of all things in the spirit, and the shape of all shapes as they must\nlive together like one being. And I saw that the sacred hoop of my people was\none of many hoops that made one circle, wide as daylight and as starlight, and\nin the center grew one mighty flowering tree to shelter all the children of one\nmother and one father. And I saw that it was holy.\n|}}\nBlack Elk had many visions throughout his life which reinforced what he had\nexperienced as a boy, and he worked among his people as a healer and\nmedicine man.\n\nBlack Elk was widely praised by many European authors, including Clyde Holler\nwho referred to Black Elk as \"the greatest religious thinker yet produced by\nNative North America.\"  He is credited with\ncreating an authentic Lakota Christianity as well as revitalizing the\ntraditional Lakota religion. Black Elk managed to identify numerous similarities\nbetween Christianity and the Lakota religion, he believed that Christianity\ncould be embraced without needing to sacrifice the Lakota identity. One of his\ngreatest achievements was being a key figure in the revival of the Sun Dance (an\nimportant religious ceremony among several tribes) and its reinstatement in\nLakota life. Lakota traditionalists now follow his version of the dance.\n\nSince the 1970's Black Elk Speaks has become one of the most commonly read texts\namongst those who study American history. It is believed to have played a\ncrucial role in the renewal of interest in Native religions, as well as\ncontributing to the United States' efforts towards environmental issues. Black\nElk worked with John Neihardt to give a first hand account of the mistreatment\nof Native Americans and the Lakota people by the United States government. His\nson Ben would translate Black Elk's stories, which were then recorded by\nNeihardt's daughter Emid, who would then put them in chronological order for\nNeihardt's use.\n\nThe American Indian Movement are thought to have been greatly influenced by\nBlack Elk - referring to Black Elk Speaks as well as his nephew and student\nFrank Fools Crow for information on Native traditions. Most members of AIM knew\nvery little about past traditions - a result of many having been brought up in\nUrban settings. Black Elk Speaks became an icon for those seeking religious and\nspiritual inspiration, with the concept of pan-Indian spirituality growing\nsupport from young people throughout the nation.\n\nBlack Elk was involved in several battles with the U.S. cavalry. He\nparticipated, at about the age of twelve, in the Battle of Little Big Horn of\n1876, known as the Battle of the Greasy Grass to the Lakota; and was injured in\nthe Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890.\n\nIn 1887, Black Elk traveled to England with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, -\n[http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/07/28/buffalo_bill_salfo-\nrd_280705_feature.shtml \"Tracking the Salford Sioux\"] an experience he\ndescribed in chapter 20 of [[Black Elk Speaks]] . [http://www.firstpeople.us/articles/Black-Elk-Speaks/Black-Elk-Speaks-\nIndex.html Black Elk Speaks] On May 11, 1887, the troop put on a command\nperformance for Queen Victoria, whom they called \"Grandmother England.\" He also\ndescribed being in the crowd at her Golden Jubilee. \"When she came to where\nwe were, her wagon stopped and she stood up. Then all those people stood up and\nroared and bowed to her: but she bowed to us.\" Neihardt, John, ed., Black Elk\nSpeaks, annotated edition, published by SUNY, 2008, pp. 176-177. (He and\nRed Shirt officiated Surrounded By the Enemy's funeral in London. The interment\nwas at Brompton Cemetery).\n\nIn spring 1888, the Wild West Show set sail for the United States. Black Elk\nbecame separated somehow and the ship left without him, stranding him with three\nother Lakota. They subsequently joined another wild west show and he spent the\nnext year in Germany, France, and Italy. When Buffalo Bill arrived in Paris in\nMay 1889, Black Elk obtained a ticket to return home to Pine Ridge, arriving in\nautumn of 1889. During his sojourn in Europe, Black Elk was given an \"abundant\nopportunity to study the white man's way of life,\" and he learned to speak\nrudimentary English.\n\nFor at least a decade, beginning in 1934, Black Elk returned to the work that he\nhad done earlier in life with Buffalo Bill - organizing an Indian Show in the\nBlack Hills. Unlike the Wild West shows which were used to glorify Indian\nwarfare, Black Elk's show was used primarily to teach tourists about Lakota\nculture and traditional sacred rituals - including the Sun Dance.\n\n, South Dakota, about 1910]]\n\nBlack Elk married his first wife, Katie War Bonnet, in 1892. She became a\nCatholic, and all three of their children were baptized as Catholic. After her\ndeath in 1903, he became a Catholic in 1904, when he was christened with the\nname of Nicholas and later served as a catechist. He continued to serve as a spiritual leader among his people,\nseeing no contradiction in embracing what he found valid in both his tribal\ntraditions concerning Wakan Tanka and those of Christianity. He remarried in\n1905 to Anna Brings White, a widow with two daughters. Together they had three\nmore children and remained together until her death in 1941.\n\nToward the end of his life, Black Elk revealed the story of his life, and a\nnumber of sacred Sioux rituals to John Neihardt and Joseph Epes Brown for\npublication, and his accounts have won wide interest and acclaim. He died August\n19, 1950 at the age of 87.\n","linknr":243,"url":"Black_Elk","recorded":1376424820,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Black_Elk&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Black_Elk&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Elk","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Black_Elk_and_Elk_of_the_Oglala_Lakota_-1887.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Black_Elk_and_Elk_of_the_Oglala_Lakota_-1887.jpg/220px-Black_Elk_and_Elk_of_the_Oglala_Lakota_-1887.jpg","/wiki/Oglala_Lakota","/wiki/Grass_dance","/wiki/Buffalo_Bill","/wiki/Powder_River_(Montana)","/wiki/Pine_Ridge_Indian_Reservation","/wiki/Manderson-White_Horse_Creek,_South_Dakota","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Medicine_Man","/wiki/Lakota_people","/wiki/Heyoka","/wiki/Crazy_Horse","/wiki/Powder_River_(Montana)","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Winter_counts","/wiki/Crow_Indians","/wiki/Tongue_River_(Montana)","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-Preface-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/John_Neihardt","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Mythologist","/wiki/Joseph_Campbell","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-Holler2000-10","/wiki/Sun_Dance","#cite_note-Holler2000-10","/wiki/Black_Elk_Speaks","/wiki/John_Neihardt","#cite_note-Holler2000-10","/wiki/American_Indian_Movement","/wiki/Black_Elk_Speaks","/wiki/Frank_Fools_Crow","#cite_note-Holler2000-10","/wiki/Battle_of_Little_Big_Horn","/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre","/wiki/Buffalo_Bill","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Black_Elk_Speaks","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Queen_Victoria","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Red_Shirt_(Oglala)","/wiki/Brompton_Cemetery","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#cite_note-14","/wiki/Buffalo_Bill","/wiki/Black_Hills","#cite_note-Neihardt2008-15","/wiki/File:Black_Elk.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Black_Elk.jpg/220px-Black_Elk.jpg","/wiki/File:Black_Elk.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Manderson,_South_Dakota","/wiki/Catholicism","/wiki/Catechist","#cite_note-Foolscrow-16","#cite_note-17","/wiki/Wakan_Tanka","/wiki/John_Neihardt","/wiki/Joseph_Epes_Brown","#Books","#See_also","#Notes","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Black_Elk&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Black_Elk&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Black_Elk_Speaks","/wiki/John_Neihardt","/wiki/Bison_Books","http://www.firstpeople.us/articles/Black-Elk-Speaks/Black-Elk-Speaks-Index.html","/wiki/University_of_Nebraska_Press","/wiki/Joseph_Epes_Brown","/w/index.php?title=MJF_Books&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/World_Wisdom","/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma_Press","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0806125411","/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma_Press","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0806140631","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0803283768","/wiki/Syracuse_University_Press","/wiki/Syracuse_University_Press","/w/index.php?title=Black_Elk&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Black_Elk&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/John_Fire_Lame_Deer","/wiki/Sitting_Bull","/wiki/I_Remain_Alive:_the_Sioux_Literary_Renaissance","/w/index.php?title=Black_Elk&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Black_Elk&veaction=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-8032-1664-5","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/Frank_Fools_Crow","#cite_ref-Preface_5-0","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-8032-1664-5","#cite_ref-6","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-8032-1664-5","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0_385_41886_8","#cite_ref-9","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-8032-1664-5","#cite_ref-Holler2000_10-0","#cite_ref-Holler2000_10-1","#cite_ref-Holler2000_10-2","#cite_ref-Holler2000_10-3","http://books.google.com/books?id=h7_j70PWw04C&pg=PA39","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-8156-2835-4","#cite_ref-11","http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/07/28/buffalo_bill_salford_280705_feature.shtml","#cite_ref-12","http://www.firstpeople.us/articles/Black-Elk-Speaks/
