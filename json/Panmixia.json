This\nassumes that there are no mating restrictions, neither genetic or behavioural,\nupon the population, and that therefore all recombination is possible. The\nWahlund effect assumes that the overall population is panmictic.\n\nIn genetics, random mating involves the mating of individuals regardless of any\nphysical, genetic, or social preference. In other words, the mating between two\norganisms is not influenced by any environmental, hereditary, or social\ninteraction. Hence, potential mates have an equal chance of being selected.\nRandom mating is a factor assumed in the Hardy-Weinberg principle and is\ndistinct from lack of natural selection: in viability selection for instance,\nselection occurs before mating.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Panmixia","recorded":1376427551,"links":[],"instances":["ecology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Population","Population genetics"],"headings":["Description","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["habitat","ecology"]],"members":["habitat"],"related":["Genetics","Behavioural","Wahlund_effect","Genetics","Mating","Hardy-Weinberg_principle","Natural_selection","Population","Habitat_(ecology)","Species","Herbivore","Forest","Natural_selection","Genetic_drift","Speciation","Local_extinction","Interbreed","Sewall_Wright","Hardy-Weinberg","F_statistics","Population_genetics"]}
