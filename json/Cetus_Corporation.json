It was\nestablished in Berkeley, California in 1971, but conducted most of its\noperations in nearby Emeryville. Before merging with another company in 1991, it\ndeveloped several significant pharmaceutical drugs as well as a revolutionary\nDNA amplification technique.\n\nCetus was founded in 1971 by Ronald E.\nCape, [http://www.chemheritage.org/exhibits/biotech/cape.html Biography of\nRonald E. Cape] Peter Farley, and Nobelist Donald A. Glaser. Its early\nefforts involved automated methods to select for industrial microorganisms that\ncould produce greater amounts of chemical feedstocks, antibiotics, or vaccine\ncomponents. By the late-1970s, however, three new revolutionary techniques had\nbeen developed: recombinant DNA, monoclonal antibodies, and gene expression, the\nfoundations of the biotechnology industry. In order to enter these new fields,\nCetus raised $108 million in an Initial Public Offering in 1981, the largest IPO\nto that date.\n\nIts first large development project, in conjunction with Triton Biosciences, was\nthe successful cloning, expression, modification, and production of beta-\ninterferon. Unfortunately, the resultant protein did not live up to its\nexpectations as a broad-spectrum anti-cancer drug, and only much later was it\napproved for use to treat symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. FDA Approves a\nMultiple Sclerosis Drug, New York Times, July 24, 1993. The product is now\nsold under the name Betaseron.\n\nThe company's flagship product was Interleukin-2 (IL-2), an important modifier\nof the immune system. Starting in the mid-1980s, the protein was cloned,\nmodified, expressed, and purified in large quantities for clinical trials. The\ndrug showed promising effects in treating renal cancer, but also had significant\nside effects on patients. In 1990 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nrefused to approve the drug for clinical use, asking for additional\ninformation. Cetus Drug is Blocked by FDA, New York Times, July 31,\n1990. It wasn't until two years later, after Cetus had been sold, that IL-\n2 was approved. It is now distributed under the name Proleukin.\n\nThe company also had a broad effort to research and develop techniques for DNA\nDiagnostics. Collaborations were made with Perkin-Elmer for diagnostic\ninstruments, and with Kodak for commercial diagnostic kits. It was here that the\ntechnique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNA amplification was conceived by\nKary Mullis. The technique has been widely used in DNA research, forensics, and\ngenetic disease diagnostics. Its inventor received the Nobel Prize in 1993, the\nonly one awarded for research performed at a biotechnology company.\n\nThe delay in FDA approval for IL-2 created a major funding crisis at Cetus,\nwhich had been spending a considerable fraction of its investments to produce\nand test the drug. [http://www.j-biomed-discovery.com/content/1/1/7/\nDetailed history of Cetus and the commercial aspects of PCR] The company's\nCEO resigned six weeks later, and patent rights to the PCR process were sold to\nHoffman-La Roche. Losses continued, and in 1991 the company was sold to Chiron\nCorporation. Two Biotech Pioneers To Merge, New York Times, July 23,\n1991. Chiron continued the development of IL-2, which was finally approved\nby the FDA in 1992. Chiron also collected the scattered rights for the\nproduction of beta-interferon, which was approved for clinical use in 1993.\n","linknr":137,"url":"Cetus_Corporation","recorded":1376416472,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Cetus_Corporation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Cetus_Corporation&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetus_Corporation","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:CetusLogo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/CetusLogo.png/250px-CetusLogo.png","/wiki/Types_of_business_entity","/wiki/Biotechnology","/wiki/Emeryville,_California","/wiki/Betaseron","/wiki/Proleukin","/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction","/wiki/Biotechnology","/wiki/Berkeley,_California","/wiki/Emeryville,_California","/wiki/DNA","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Nobelist","/wiki/Donald_A._Glaser","/wiki/Recombinant_DNA","/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies","/wiki/Gene_expression","/wiki/Initial_Public_Offering","/w/index.php?title=Triton_Biosciences&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Molecular_cloning","/wiki/Interferon_beta-1b","/wiki/Cancer","/wiki/Multiple_Sclerosis","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Betaseron","/wiki/Interleukin-2","/wiki/Cytokine","/wiki/Immune_system","/wiki/Clinical_Trials","/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma","/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Proleukin","/wiki/PerkinElmer","/wiki/Kodak","/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction","/wiki/Kary_Mullis","/wiki/Molecular_biology","/wiki/Forensics","/wiki/Genetic_testing","/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer","/wiki/Hoffman-La_Roche","/wiki/Chiron_Corporation","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Cetus_Corporation&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Cetus_Corporation&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.chemheritage.org/exhibits/biotech/cape.html","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","http://www.j-biomed-discovery.com/content/1/1/7/","#cite_ref-5","/w/index.php?title=Cetus_Corporation&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Cetus_Corporation&veaction=edit&section=2","http://books.google.ca/books?id=tl-VuLDM_TUC&dq=Making+PCR:+a+Story+of+Biotechnology&source=gbs_navlinks_s","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0226701476","http://books.google.com/books/about/Biotech.html?id=HHV6EzcSPKUC","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0812239474","http://pharmalicensing.com/features/disp/1130421281_4360dc215fedf","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cetus_Corporation&oldid=514343475","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Biotechnology_companies_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Emeryville,_California","/wiki/Category:Companies_based_in_Berkeley,_California","/wiki/Category:Technology_companies_based_in_the_San_Francisco_Bay_Area","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Cetus+Corporation&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Cetus+Corporation","/wiki/Cetus_Corporation","/wiki/Talk:Cetus_Corporation","#","/wiki/Cetus_Corporation","/w/index.php?title=Cetus_Corporation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Cetus_Corporation&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Cetus_Corporation&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Cetus_Corporation","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Cetus_Corporation","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Cetus_Corporation&oldid=514343475","/w/index.php?title=Cetus_Corporation&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5065711","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Cetus_Corporation&id=514343475","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Cetus+Corporation","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=rend
