Around 12.5–14.0 cm (5.0–5.5 in)\nin length, the male and female are similar in colouration, with an orange breast\nand face lined with grey, brown upperparts and a whitish belly. It is found\nacross Europe, east to Western Siberia and south to North Africa; it is\nsedentary in most of its range except the far north.\n\nThe term Robin is also applied to some birds in other families with red or\norange breasts. These include the American Robin (Turdus migratorius), which is\na thrush, and the Australian red robins of the genus [[Petroica]], members of a\nfamily whose relationships are unclear.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"European_Robin","recorded":1376428720,"links":[],"instances":["americas","colour","bird","soccer","bird","unit","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Birds of Europe","Birds of Asia","Erithacus","Animals described in 1758"],"headings":["Taxonomy and systematics","Description","Distribution and habitat","Behaviour and ecology","Cultural depictions","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["thrush","bird"],["chat","bird"],["thrush","bird"],["orange","fruit"],["chat","bird"],["morphology","biology"],["mya","unit"],["orange","colour"],["middle_america","americas"],["football","soccer"]],"members":["middle_america","orange","thrush","football","chat","mya","morphology"],"related":["Toulouse","Animal","Chordate","Bird","Passerine","Old_World_flycatcher","Carolus_Linnaeus","Subspecies","English-speaking_world","Europe","Insectivorous","Passerine","Bird","Thrush_(bird)","Chat_(bird)","American_Robin","Thrush_(bird)","Carolus_Linnaeus","Latin","Georges_Cuvier","Binomial_nomenclature","Orange_(fruit)","West_Frisian_language","Insectivorous","Old_World_flycatcher","Taxonomically","Common_Nightingale","Chat_(bird)","Palearctic","Japanese_Robin","Ryūkyū_Robin","Biogeography","MtDNA","Cytochrome_b","DNA_sequence","Far_East","Subspecies","British_Isles","Africa","Corsica","Sardinia","Crimean_Peninsula","Transcaucasia","Iran","Madeira","Azores","Morphology_(biology)","Gran_Canaria","Tenerife","Mya_(unit)","Probabilistic","Inference","Molecular_clock","Middle_Pleistocene","Canary_Islands","El_Hierro","La_Palma","La_Gomera","Fuerteventura","Lanzarote","Africa","Europe","American_Robin","Orange_(colour)","London","Middle_America_(Americas)","Rufous-collared_Robin","Scarlet_Robin","Crow","Jay","Petroicidae","Red-billed_Leiothrix","Aviculture","Magpie-robin","Oriental_Magpie_Robin","Gram","Ounce","Siberia","Algeria","Atlantic_Ocean","Azores","Madeira","Iceland","Caucasus","Europe","Scandinavia","Russia","Melbourne","Auckland","Christchurch","Wellington","Dunedin","Acclimatisation_society","Long_Island","Oregon","Saanich_Peninsula","British_Columbia","Diurnality","Earthworm","Folklore","Wild_boar","Life_expectancy","Moorhen_flea","Ireland","Common_Nightingale","Sheffield","Magnetoreception","Quantum_entanglement","Thor","Norse_mythology","Christmas","Christmas_card","Folklore","Jesus","Queen_Victoria","Wales","Football_(soccer)","Bristol_City","Swindon_Town","Cheltenham_Town","Wrexham_FC","Hull_Kingston_Rovers","Swindon_Robins","Motorcycle_speedway","RSPB","SR_P2"]}
