As their common name suggests, they are often seen\nhovering or nectaring at flowers; the adults of many species feed mainly on\nnectar and pollen, while the larvae (maggots) eat a wide range of foods. In some\nspecies, the larvae are saprotrophs, eating decaying plant and animal matter in\nthe soil or in ponds and streams. In other species, the larvae are insectivores\nand prey on aphids, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects.\n\nAphids alone cause tens of millions of dollars of damage to crops worldwide\nevery year; because of this, aphidophagous hoverflies are being recognized as\nimportant natural enemies of pests, and potential agents for use in biological\ncontrol. Some adult syrphid flies are important pollinators.\n\nAbout 6,000 species in 200 genera have been described. Hoverflies are common\nthroughout the world and can be found on all continents except Antarctica.\nHoverflies are harmless to most other animals despite their mimicry of more\ndangerous wasps and bees, which serves to ward off predators.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Syrphidae","recorded":1376427543,"links":[],"instances":["organism","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hoverflies|","Pollinators","Agriculturally beneficial insects","Biological pest control agents","Insect families"],"headings":["Description","Reproduction and life cycle","Distribution and habitat","Systematics","Relationship with people","Identification guides","Regional Lists","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["family","biology"],["pest","organism"],["tribe","biology"]],"members":["pest","tribe","family"],"related":["Animal","Arthropod","Insect","Fly","Brachycera","Aschiza","Syrphoidea","Pierre_Andr√©_Latreille","Eristalinae","Microdontinae","Syrphinae","Family_(biology)","Common_name","Flower","Species","Nectar","Pollen","Larva","Maggot","Saprotroph","Insectivore","Aphid","Thrip","Aphidophagous","Predation","Pest_(organism)","Biological_control","Pollinator","Genus","Antarctica","Batesian_mimicry","Wasp","Bee","Diptera","Wasps","Bee","Batesian_mimicry","Maggot","Saprotrophs","Insectivores","Aphids","Thrip","Biological_control","Pollination","Rat-tailed_maggot","Drone_fly","Ice_fishing","Itch","Cosmopolitan_distribution","Biome","Tundra","Antarctica","American_hoverfly","Nearctic_ecozone","Ecozone","Common_hoverfly","Australasia_ecozone","Myrmecophile","Genera_of_Syrphidae","Aphid","Leafhopper","Curly_top","Companion_plant","Alyssum","Statice","Buckwheat","Chamomile","Parsley","Yarrow","Tribe_(biology)","List_of_hoverfly_species_of_Great_Britain","List_of_New_Zealand_Flower_Flies","List_of_the_Flower_Flies_of_North_America"]}
