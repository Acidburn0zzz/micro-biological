{"cursor":"1460","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Endopeptidase' or 'endoproteinase' are proteolytic peptidases that break\npeptide bonds of nonterminal amino acids (i.e. within the molecule), in contrast\nto exopeptidases, which break peptide bonds from their end-pieces. For this\nreason, endopeptidases cannot break down peptides into monomers, while\nexopeptidases can break down proteins into monomers. A particular case of\nendopeptidase is the oligopeptidase, whose substrates are oligopeptides instead\nof proteins.\n\nThey are usually very specific for certain amino acids. Examples of\nendopeptidases include:\n\n* Trypsin - cuts after Arg or Lys, unless followed by Pro. Very strict. Works\n  best at pH 8.\n* Chymotrypsin - cuts after Phe, Trp, or Tyr, unless followed by Pro. Cuts more\n  slowly after His, Met or Leu. Works best at pH 8.\n* Elastase - cuts after Ala, Gly, Ser, or Val, unless followed by Pro.\n* Thermolysin - cuts before Ile, Met, Phe, Trp, Tyr, or Val, unless preceded by\n  Pro. Sometimes cuts after Ala, Asp, His or Thr. Heat stable.\n* Pepsin - cuts before Leu, Phe, Trp or Tyr, unless preceded by Pro. Also\n  others, quite nonspecific; works best at pH 2.\n* Endopeptidase V8 (alias Glu-C) - cuts after Glu. Works best at pH 8.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"endopeptidase","recorded":1376427647,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 3.4"],"headings":["References","External links","See also"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Proteolysis","Peptidase","Peptide_bonds","Amino_acid","Exopeptidase","Oligopeptidase","Trypsin","Chymotrypsin","Elastase","Thermolysin","Pepsin","Endopeptidase_V8","Exopeptidase","The_Proteolysis_Map"]}
