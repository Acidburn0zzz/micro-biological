The system has been duplicated by\nmost of the show's successors in the judicial genre. Moreover, The People's\nCourt is the first popular, long-running reality in the judicial genre. It was\npreceded only by a few short-lived realities in the genre; these short-lived\npredecessors were only loosely related to judicial proceedings, except for one:\n[[Court show#List of originally nontraditional court shows|Parole]] (1959) took\nfootage from real-life courtrooms holding legal proceedings. http://tarlton-\n.law.utexas.edu/exhibits/mason_&_associates/documents/reality_series_by_title.p-\ndf Prior to The People's Court, the vast majority of TV courtroom shows\nused actors, and recreated or fictional cases (as did radio before that). Among\nexamples of these types of court shows include [[Famous Jury Trials]] and [[Your\nWitness (TV series)|Your Witness]].\n\nThe People's Court has had two contrasting lives. The show's first life was\npresided over solely by former Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Joseph\nWapner. [http://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/08/arts/tv-people-s-\ncourt-reality-in-the-morning.html \"TV: 'People's Court', 'Reality' in the\nMorning\"], New York Times, September 8, 1981 His tenure lasted from the\nshow's debut on September 14, 1981, until May 21, 1993, when the show was\ncancelled due to low ratings. This left the show with a total of\n2,484 Â½-hour episodes and 12 seasons. The show was taped in Los Angeles during\nits first life. After being cancelled, reruns aired until September 9,\n1994. The Intelligencer â September 9, 1994\n\nOn September 8, 1997, after being out of production for four years, The People's\nCourt was revived for a second life in first-run syndication as a 60-minute\nprogram. Former lawyer and Mayor of New York Ed Koch was chosen as arbiter,\nwhich he maintained for 2 seasons from the 1997â98 season through the 1998â99\nseason (the present life's 2nd season and overall show's 14th). By the 1999â00\nseason, former New York State Supreme Court Judge Jerry Sheindlin, the husband\nof Judith Sheindlin (who presides over [[Judge Judy]]) succeeded Koch. Sheindlin\nlasted one and a half seasons as he was replaced towards the end of the 2000â01\nseason (present life's 4th season and overall show's 17th).\n\nBeginning in spring 2001, Florida judge Marilyn Milian took over The People's\nCourt and has presided over the show ever since. Once Milian completes the\n2012â13 season, she will have served as longest arbiter over the series with 12\nand a half seasons. As of the present, however, her years on the program tie\nWapner at 12 seasons. In the 2009-10 television season, The People's Courts\n2nd/present life outlasted its first when it reached 13 seasons. While the show\ntaped in New York City for the first 15 seasons of its second life, it now tapes\nin Stamford, Connecticut as of the 2012-13 season.\n\nOn September 3, 2012, The People's Court's 2nd/present life entered its 16th\nseason (28th overall season). http://www.tvtango.com/news/detail/id/471/70-syndicated-and-\ndaytime-series-premiere-dates-for-fall-2012 With 28 total seasons, The\nPeople's Court ranks as the 2nd longest-running courtroom program behind the\nongoing [[Divorce Court]] at 33 seasons (from its 3 combined lives).\n","linknr":384,"url":"The_Peoples_Court","recorded":1376419795,"links":["/w/index.php?title=The_People%27s_Court&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_People%27s_Court&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Court","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=The_Peoples_Court&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/People%27s_Court_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:People%27sCourt.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f7/People%27sCourt.png","/wiki/Reality_television#reality_court_shows","/wiki/Court_show","/wiki/Doug_Llewelyn","/wiki/Harvey_Levin","/wiki/Joseph_Wapner","/wiki/Ed_Koch","/wiki/Jerry_Sheindlin","/wiki/Marilyn_Milian","/wiki/Curt_Chaplin","/wiki/Alan_Tew","/wiki/Ralph_Edwards","/wiki/Multiple-camera_setup","/wiki/Telepictures","/wiki/Lorimar-Telepictures","/wiki/Warner_Bros._Television_Distribution","/wiki/Broadcast_syndication#First-run_syndication_in_the_U.S.","/wiki/SDTV","/wiki/480i","/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)#4:3","/wiki/Widescreen","/wiki/Stereo","http://www.peoplescourt.com","/wiki/American_television","/wiki/Court_show#Arbitration-based_reality_court_show","/wiki/Court_show","/wiki/Florida","/wiki/Circuit_court#State_courts","/wiki/Marilyn_Milian","/wiki/Small_claims_court","/wiki/Arbitration","/wiki/Court_show#List_of_originally_nontraditional_court_shows","/wiki/Court_show#List_of_originally_nontraditional_court_shows","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Actor","/wiki/Judge_show#List_of_originally_traditional_court_shows","/wiki/Court_show#Precursor","/wiki/Famous_Jury_Trials","/wiki/Your_Witness_(TV_series)","/wiki/Los_Angeles_County","/wiki/Superior_Court","/wiki/Joseph_Wapner","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Los_Angeles","/wiki/Cancellation_(television)","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York","/wiki/Ed_Koch","/wiki/New_York_State_Supreme_Court","/wiki/Jerry_Sheindlin","/wiki/Judith_Sheindlin","/wiki/Judge_Judy","/wiki/Marilyn_Milian","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Stamford,_Connecticut","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Divorce_Court","#Show_history","#Conception","#The_People.27s_Court.27s_first_life:_Wapner_era","#Ending_of_the_show.27s_first_life","#The_People.27s_Court.27s_second.2Fpresent_life","#Ed_Koch_and_Jerry_Sheindlin_eras","#Marilyn_Milian_era","#Series_overview","#Opening_monologue","#Litigant_compensation","#Ratings","#Production_notes","#Theme_music","#Syndication","#British_version","#In_popular_culture","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=The_People%27s_Court&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=The_People%27s_Court&veaction=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=The_People%27s_Court&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=The_People%27s_Court&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/Monty_Hall","/wiki/Let%27s_Make_a_Deal","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Ralph_Edwards","/wiki/This_Is_Your_Life","/wiki/Moral_Court","/wiki/Breakfast_in_Hollywood","/w/index.php?title=The_People%27s_Court&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=The_People%27s_Court&veaction=edit&section=3","/wiki/Joseph_Wapner","/wiki/Bailiff","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Catchphrase","/wiki/Southern_California","/wiki/Arbitration","#cite_note-NYT1989-9","/w/index.php?title=The_People%27s_Court&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=The_People%27s_Court&veaction=edit&section=4","/wiki/The_San_Francisco_Chronicle","/wiki/Ed_Koch","/wiki/Jerry_Sheindlin","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=The_People%27s_Court&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=The_People%27s_Court&veaction=edit&section=5","/wiki/Small_claims_court","/wiki/Florida","/wiki/WCBS-TV","/wiki/Harvey_Levin","/wiki/Manhattan_Mall","/wiki/TMZ.com","/wiki/Third_Street_Promenade","/wiki/Santa_Monica,_California","/w/index.php?title=The_People%27s_Court&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=The_People%27s_Court&veaction=edit&section=6","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Ed_Koch","#cite_note-Sheindlin-11","/wiki/Jerry_Sheindlin","/wiki/Judith_Sheindlin","/wiki/Judge_Judy","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-13","#cite_note-Sheindlin-11","#cite_note-lovell-14","/w/index.php?title=The_People%27s_Court&action=edit&section=7","
