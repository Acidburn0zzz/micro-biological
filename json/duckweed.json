Also known as\n\"bayroot\", they arose from within the arum or aroid family (Araceae), and therefore, often are classified as the subfamily\n'Lemnoideae' within the Araceae. Classifications created prior to the end of the\ntwentieth century classify them as a separate family, 'Lemnaceae'.\n\nThese plants are very simple, lacking an obvious stem or leaves. The greater\npart of each plant is a small organized \"thallus\" or \"frond\" structure only a\nfew cells thick, often with air pockets (aerenchyma) that allow it to float on\nor just under the water surface. Depending on the species each plant may have no\nroot or may have one or more simple rootlets.\n\nReproduction is mostly by asexual budding, which occurs from a meristem enclosed\nat the base of the frond. Occasionally three tiny \"flowers\" consisting of two\nstamens and a pistil are produced, by which sexual reproduction occurs. Some\nview this \"flower\" as a pseudanthium, or reduced inflorescence, with three\nflowers that are distinctly either female or male and which are derived from the\nspadix in Araceae. Evolution of the duckweed inflorescence remains ambiguous due\nto the considerable evolutionary reduction of these plants from their earlier\nrelatives.\n\nThe flower of the duckweed genus Wolffia is the smallest known, measuring merely\n0.3 mm long. The fruit produced through this occasional sexual\nreproduction is a [[utricle (fruit)|utricle]], and a seed is produced in a sac\ncontaining air that facilitates flotation.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"duckweed","recorded":1376429144,"links":[],"instances":["nutrient","spain","biology","phylogenetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant taxonomy","Aquatic plants","Araceae","Plant subfamilies","Phytoremediation plants"],"headings":["Duckweed in various environments","Taxonomy","Research","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["protein","nutrient"],["fry","biology"],["basal","phylogenetics"],["galicia","spain"]],"members":["protein","galicia","fry","basal"],"related":["Plantae","Angiosperms","Monocots","Alismatales","Araceae","Aquatic_plant","Wetlands","Araceae","Aerenchyma","Asexual_reproduction","Stamens","Pistil","Sexual_reproduction","Pseudanthium","Inflorescence","Spadix","Seed","Protein_(nutrient)","Waterfowl","Fry_(biology)","Bullfrog","Bluegill","Photoautotrophic","Algae","Nitrate","Bioremediation","Nitrogen","Phosphates","Waste_water_treatment","Mosquitoes","Evaporation","Molecular_phylogeny","Gymnostachydoideae","Orontioideae","Polyploid","Basal_(phylogenetics)","Plastid","Consortium_for_the_Barcode_of_Life","Rutgers_University","North_Carolina_State_University","Renewable_energy","Biomass","Galicia_(Spain)","Marais_Poitevin","Bald_cypress","Phytoremediation","Hyperaccumulators_table_–_3"]}
