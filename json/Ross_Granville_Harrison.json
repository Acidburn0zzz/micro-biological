Announcing in his mid teens a resolve to study medicine, he entered\nJohns Hopkins University in 1886, receiving his BA degree in 1889 at the age of\nnineteen. In 1890, he worked as a laboratory assistant for the United States\nFish Commission, studying the embryology of the oyster with his close friend E.\nG. Conklin and H. V. Wilson. J. S. Nicholas, Ross Granville Harrison\n1870â1959 A Biographical Memoir, National Academy of Sciences, 1961, Accessed\nMay 2008 at http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/rharrison.pdf\n\nIn 1891, he participated in a marine zoology field trip to Jamaica. He worked in\nBonn, Germany during 1892â3, 1895â6 and 1898, attracted to the work of Moritz\nNussbaum, becoming an M.D. there in 1899. He gained his Ph.D. in 1894 after\ncourses in physiology with H. Newell Martin and morphology with William Keith\nBrooks. He devoted study to mathematics, astronomy and also the Latin and Greek\nclassics. He worked with T. H. Morgan as a lecturer in morphology at Bryn Mawr.\nHe married Ida Lange in Altona, Germany on January 9, 1896 and they had a family\nof five children.\n\nFrom 1899 until 1907 he was the Associate Professor of Anatomy at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, teaching histology and embryology. By this time he had contributed\nmore than twenty papers and made the acquaintance of many leading biologists.\nHis work on tissue culture became very influential.\n\nHe then moved to New Haven to take up a post at Yale University, where he was\nBronson Professor of Comparative Anatomy, participating through to 1913 in a\nrevitalisation and re-organisation of the several faculties of which he became a\nmember. He undertook further studies at the United States Fish Commission in the\nearly years of the century. In 1913 he was elected to the National Academy of\nSciences and the American Philosophical Society. J. S. Nicholas, op.\ncit. From 1914 until his retirement in 1938, Harrison was the Medical\nSchool's chief advisor on staffing.\n\nThe first world war was not a happy time for Harrison, with his pacifist\nleanings and his German wife and studies, but he persevered with embryology,\nworking upon the symmetries of development. By means of the dissection of\nembryos followed by transplantation and rotatation of the limb bud he\ndemonstrated that the main axes of the developing limb are determined\nindependently and at slightly different times, determination of the anterior-\nposterior axis preceding that of the dorsal-ventral axis.\n\nHe successfully cultured frog neuroblasts in a lymph medium and thereby took the\nfirst step toward current research on precursor and stem cells. He was\nconsidered for a Nobel prize for his work on nerve-cell outgrowth, which helped\nform the modern functional understanding of the nervous system, and he\ncontributed to surgical tissue transplant technique.\n\nAfter his retirement he was called upon several times as an advisor to the U.S.\ngovernment and his organisational skills were of paramount importance in\nestablishing links between scientists, the government and the media. He was\nChairman of the National Research Council from 1938 to 1946. He was a member of\nthe Science Committee of the National Resources Planning Board in 1938 and\nchairman of the Committee on Civil Service Improvement in 1939. He was awarded\nmany prizes and officiated in many learned societies. Thomas L. Lentz,\nHistory of the Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of\nMedicine. He edited the Journal of Experimental Zoology until 1946. He\nalso served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society\nfor Science & the Public, from 1938â1956.\n\nAlthough a keen morphogeneticist and an admirer of Goethe, Harrison himself did\nnot philosophise much in his papers and, being somewhat reserved and diffident\nin his social dealings despite his warm feelings for his students' attainment,\ndid not enjoy lecturing but chiefly confined himself to organisation,\npublication (his textbook illustrations have been highly praised) and patient\nexperiment. He remained a keen walker all his life.\n","linknr":145,"url":"Ross_Granville_Harrison","recorded":1376417307,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ross_Granville_Harrison&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ross_Granville_Harrison&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Granville_Harrison","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Ross_Granville_Harrison.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Ross_Granville_Harrison.jpg/180px-Ross_Granville_Harrison.jpg","/wiki/Germantown,_Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/New_Haven","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Biology","/wiki/Anatomy","/wiki/Bryn_Mawr_College","/wiki/Yale_University","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University","/wiki/University_of_Bonn","/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","#cite_note-frs-1","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Tissue_culture","/wiki/Baltimore","/wiki/Germantown","/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Jamaica","/wiki/Bonn","/wiki/Germany","/w/index.php?title=Moritz_Nussbaum&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/William_Keith_Brooks","/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University","/wiki/Yale_University","/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","/wiki/American_Philosophical_Society","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Neuroblast","/wiki/Lymph","/wiki/Stem_cells","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Society_for_Science_%26_the_Public","/wiki/Goethe","/w/index.php?title=Ross_Granville_Harrison&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Ross_Granville_Harrison&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Alexander_Gurwitsch","/wiki/Hans_Spemann","/wiki/Paul_Alfred_Weiss","/w/index.php?title=Ross_Granville_Harrison&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Ross_Granville_Harrison&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-frs_1-0","/wiki/Michael_Abercrombie","/wiki/Biographical_Memoirs_of_Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1098%2Frsbm.1961.0009","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Cite_doi/10.1098.2Frsbm.1961.0009&action=edit&editintro=Template:Cite_doi/editintro2","#cite_ref-2","http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/rharrison.pdf","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/5010223","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Germantown,_Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/New_Haven","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ross_Granville_Harrison&oldid=559891725","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1870_births","/wiki/Category:1959_deaths","/wiki/Category:American_biologists","/wiki/Category:American_anatomists","/wiki/Category:Foreign_Members_of_the_Royal_Society","/wiki/Category:United_States_Fish_Commission_personnel","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ross+Granville+Harrison&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ross+Granville+Harrison","/wiki/Ross_Granville_Harrison","/wiki/Talk:Ross_Granville_Harrison","#","/wiki/Ross_Granville_Harrison","/w/index.php?title=Ross_Granville_Harrison&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ross_Granville_Harrison&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ross_Granville_Harrison&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Ross_Granville_Harrison","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Ross_Granville_Harrison","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=R
