'Foliage' is a mass noun that refers to leaves as a feature\n of plants. Haupt, Arthur Wing, Plant morphology. Publisher: McGraw-Hill\n 1953.

Publisher:\n Jones & Bartlett, 2008 ISBN 978-0763753450\n\nTypically a leaf is a thin, flattened organ borne above ground and specialized\nfor photosynthesis, but many types of leaves are adapted in ways almost\nunrecognisable in those terms: some are not flat (for example many succulent\nleaves and conifers), some are not above ground (such as bulb scales), and some\nare without major photosynthetic function (consider for example cataphylls,\nspines, and cotyledons).\n\nConversely, many structures of non-vascular plants, or even of some lichens,\nwhich are not plants at all (in the sense of being members of the kingdom\nPlantae), do look and function much like leaves. Furthermore, several structures\nfound in vascular plants look like leaves but are not actually leaves; they\ndiffer from leaves in their structures and origins. Examples include phyllodes,\ncladodes, and phylloclades.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Leaf","recorded":1376428025,"links":[],"instances":["optics","botany","geometry","colour","botany","chemistry","anatomy","botany","biophysical","botany","nutrition","biology","botany","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Leaves|","Plant anatomy","Plant morphology","Plant physiology","Photosynthesis"],"headings":["General nature of leaves","Large-scale features (leaf morphology)","Anatomy","Seasonal leaf loss","Morphology","Terminology","Adaptations","Interactions with other organisms","Bibliography","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["organ","anatomy"],["petiole","botany"],["diet","nutrition"],["petiole","botany"],["epidermis","botany"],["cell","biology"],["transparency","optics"],["assimilation","biology"],["absorption","chemistry"],["ramification","botany"],["orange","colour"],["rosette","botany"],["petiole","botany"],["parallel","geometry"],["environment","biophysical"],["spine","botany"]],"members":["transparency","rosette","parallel","orange","ramification","absorption","organ","petiole","environment","spine","diet","assimilation","epidermis","cell"],"related":["Voxel","Organ_(anatomy)","Vascular_plant","Botany","Plant_morphology","Mass_noun","Plant","Photosynthesis","Succulent_plant","Pinophyta","Bulb","Cataphyll","Thorns,_spines,_and_prickles","Cotyledon","Lichen","Plant","Plant","Petiole_(botany)","Cladode","Phylloclade","Light","Pendent","Willow","Organelles","Chloroplast","Light","Carbon_dioxide","Stomata","Oxygen","Water_vapour","Atmosphere","Ultraviolet","Xerophyte","Flux","Light_intensity","Window_plants","Fenestraria","Haworthia","Haworthia_truncata","Bulbine","Isobilateral","Dorsiventral","Transpiration","Guttation","Food","Water","Protein","Minerals","Sugars","Diet_(nutrition)","Animal","Human","Leaf_vegetable","Staple_food","Phytolith","Lignin","Tannin","Poison","Bryophyte","Moss","Marchantiophyta","Non-vascular_plant","Devonian_period","Microphyll","Lycophytes","Fern","Gymnosperm","Angiosperm","Microphyll","Flowering_plant","Petiole_(botany)","Stipule","Bud","Xylem","Phloem","Trichome","Vascular_tissue","Trichome","Stoma","Epidermis_(botany)","Cell_(biology)","Transpiration","Metabolism","Transparency_(optics)","Plant_cuticle","Trichome","Monocot","Dicot","Assimilation_(biology)","Absorption_(chemistry)","Capillary_action","Green","Chlorophyll","Plastid","Photosynthesis","Carotene","Xanthophyll","Vascular_tissue","Venation","Pattern_formation","Ramification_(botany)","Tensor_field","Vascular_bundle","Xylem","Phloem","Sap","Lignin","Temperate","Boreal_ecosystem","Deciduous","Abscission","Autumn_leaf_color","Yellow","Orange_(colour)","Red","Carotenoid","Xanthophyll","Sunlight","Anthocyanin","Aphids","Species","Terminology","Fern","Fronds","Conifer","Flowering_plant","Lycopodiophyta","Microphyll","Monocotyledon","Poaceae","Phyllotaxis","Decussate","Rosette_(botany)","Microphyll","Helix","Clockwise_and_counterclockwise","Fibonacci_sequence","Golden_angle","Numerator","Leaflet","Fabaceae","Frond","Rachis","Petiole_(botany)","Phyllode","Stipule","Dicotyledon","Rose","Bean","Ochrea","Rhubarb","Dicotyledon","Melastomataceae","Divergence","Maple","Parallel_(geometry)","Monocotyledon","Poaceae","Fern","Plesiomorph","Seed_plant","Autapomorph","Melanthiaceae","Beech","Chestnut","Elm","Oak","Nettle","Holly","Thistle","Glaucous","Microorganisms","Phyllosphere","Trichome","Bract","Petal","Evolution","Environment_(biophysical)","Boundary_layer","Wax","Succulent","CAM_photosynthesis","Aromatic_oil","Poisons","Pheromones","Eucalypts","Silica","Phytolith","Grass","Raphides","Araceae","Petal","Spine_(botany)","Cacti","Carnivorous_plant","Bulb","Onion","Tendril","Pea","Bract","Pseudanthium","Spurge","Spathe","Tettigoniidae","Folivore","Tannin","Crypsis","Tortricidae","Pamphiliidae","Attelabidae","Mimicry","Katydid","Ghillean_Tolmie_Prance","London","Phyllode","Evolution_of_leaves","Leaf_Area_Index","Leaf_protein_concentrate","Leaf_sensor","Vernation"]}
