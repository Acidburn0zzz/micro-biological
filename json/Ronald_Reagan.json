Before\nthat, he was the 33rd Governor of California (1967â1975), and a radio, film and\ntelevision actor.\n\nBorn in Tampico, Illinois, and raised in Dixon, Reagan was educated at Eureka\nCollege, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and sociology. After\ngraduating, Reagan moved first to Iowa to work as a radio broadcaster and then,\nin 1937, to Los Angeles where he began a career as an actor, first in films and\nlater television. Some of his most notable films include [[Knute Rockne, All\nAmerican]] (1940), [[Kings Row]] (1942), and [[Bedtime for Bonzo]] (1951).\nReagan served as President of the Screen Actors Guild and later as a spokesman\nfor General Electric (GE); his start in politics occurred during his work for\nGE. Originally a member of the Democratic Party, his positions began shifting\nrightward in the 1950s, and he switched to the Republican Party in 1962.

Reagansheritage.org.\nRetrieved on 2013-07-15.\n\nAfter delivering a rousing speech in support of Barry Goldwater's presidential\ncandidacy in 1964, he was persuaded to seek the California governorship, winning\ntwo years later and again in 1970. He was defeated in his run for the Republican\npresidential nomination in 1968 and in 1976, but won both the nomination and\ngeneral election in 1980, defeating incumbent Jimmy Carter.\n\nAs president, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic\ninitiatives. His supply-side economic policies, dubbed \"Reaganomics\", advocated\nreducing tax rates to spur economic growth, controlling the money supply to\nreduce inflation, deregulation of the economy, and reducing government spending.\nIn his first term he survived an assassination attempt, took a hard line against\nlabor unions, announced a new War on Drugs, and ordered an invasion of Grenada.\nHe was re-elected in a landslide in 1984, proclaiming that it was \"Morning in\nAmerica\". His second term was primarily marked by foreign matters, such as the\nending of the Cold War, the 1986 bombing of Libya, and the revelation of the\nIranâContra affair. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an \"evil\nempire\", he supported anti-communist movements worldwide and spent\nhis first term forgoing the strategy of dÃ©tente by ordering a massive military\nbuildup in an arms race with the USSR. Reagan negotiated with Soviet General\nSecretary Mikhail Gorbachev, culminating in the INF Treaty and the decrease of\nboth countries' nuclear arsenals.\n\nReagan left office in 1989. In 1994, the former president disclosed that he had\nbeen diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier in the year; he died ten years\nlater at the age of 93. A conservative icon, he ranks highly in public opinion\npolls of U.S. Presidents and is credited for generating an ideological\nrenaissance on the American political right.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Ronald_Reagan","recorded":1376418468,"links":[],"instances":["1985","1981","medicine","mississippi_river","illinois","polish_trade_union","am","american_politician","1987","united_states","drug","united_states","political_strategist","am","united_states","united_states","united_states","anatomy","disciples_of_christ","united_states","united_states","united_states","murderer","housing","poland","united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1911
