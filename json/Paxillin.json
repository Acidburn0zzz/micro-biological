E., Glenney, J. R., Jr. & Burridge,\nK. Paxillin: a new vinculin-binding protein present in focal adhesions. J Cell\nBiol 111, 1059â1068 (1990). The C-terminal region of paxillin contains\nfour LIM domains that target paxillin to focal adhesions. It is presumed through\na direct association with the cytoplasmic tail of beta-integrin. The N-terminal\nregion of paxillin is rich in proteinâprotein interaction sites. The proteins\nthat bind to paxillin are diverse and include protein tyrosine kinases, such as\nSrc and FAK, structural proteins, such as vinculin and actopaxin, and regulators\nof actin organization, such as COOL/PIX and PKL/GIT. Paxillin is tyrosine-\nphosphorylated by FAK and Src upon integrin engagement or growth factor\nstimulation, creating binding sites for the adapter protein Crk.
