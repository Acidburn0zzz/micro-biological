The acronym serpin\nwas originally coined because many serpins inhibit chymotrypsin-like serine\nproteases ('ser'ine 'p'rotease 'in'hibitors).\n\nThe first members of the serpin superfamily to be extensively studied were the\nhuman plasma proteins antithrombin and antitrypsin, which play key roles in\ncontrolling blood coagulation (e.g. Figure 1) and inflammation, respectively.\nInitially, research focused upon their role in human disease: antithrombin\ndeficiency results in thrombosis and antitrypsin deficiency causes emphysema. In\n1980 Hunt and Dayhoff made the surprising discovery that both these molecules\nshare significant amino acid sequence similarity to the major protein in chicken\negg white, ovalbumin, and they proposed a new protein superfamily.\nOver 1000 serpins have now been identified, these include 36 human proteins, as\nwell as molecules in plants, fungi, bacteria, archaea and certain viruses.\nSerpins are thus the largest and most diverse family of protease inhibitors.\n\nWhile most serpins control proteolytic cascades, certain serpins do not inhibit\nenzymes, but instead perform diverse functions such as storage (ovalbumin, in\negg white), hormone carriage proteins (thyroxine-binding globulin, cortisol-\nbinding globulin) and tumor suppressor genes (maspin). The term serpin is used\nto describe these latter members as well, despite their noninhibitory\nfunction.\n\nAs serpins control processes such as coagulation and inflammation, these\nproteins are the target of medical research. However, serpins are also of\nparticular interest to the structural biology and protein folding communities,\nbecause they undergo a unique and dramatic change in shape (or conformational\nchange) when they inhibit target proteases. This is\nunusual â most classical protease inhibitors function as simple \"lock and\nkey\" molecules that bind to and block access to the protease active site (see,\nfor example, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor). While the serpin mechanism of\nprotease inhibition confers certain advantages, it also has drawbacks, and\nserpins are vulnerable to mutations that result in protein misfolding and the\nformation of inactive long-chain polymers (serpinopathies). Serpin\npolymerisation reduces the amount of active inhibitor, as well as accumulation\nof serpin polymers, causing cell death and organ failure. For example, the\nserpin antitrypsin is primarily produced in the liver, and antitrypsin\npolymerisation causes liver cirrhosis. Understanding\nserpinopathies also provides insights on protein misfolding in general, a\nprocess common to many human diseases, such as Alzheimerâs and Creutzfeldt-Jakob\ndisease.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Serine_protease_inhibitor","recorded":1376427651,"links":[],"instances":["biochemistry","biochemistry","protein","biology","gene"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Serine
