The action differs\nfrom precipitation in that, prior to flocculation, colloids are merely suspended\nin a liquid and not actually dissolved in a solution. In the flocculated system,\nthere is no formation of a cake, since all the flocs are in the suspension.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"flocculation","recorded":1376418394,"links":[],"instances":["geology","chemistry","disambiguation","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Metallurgy","Chemical processes","Sewerage","Water treatment","Separation processes"],"headings":["Term definition","Applications","Deflocculation","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":[],"tags":[["suspension","chemistry"],["precipitation","chemistry"],["coalescence","chemistry"],["aggregation","disambiguation"],["deposition","geology"]],"members":["deposition","coalescence","aggregation","precipitation","suspension"],"related":["Chemistry","Colloid","Suspension_(chemistry)","Clarifying_agent","Precipitation_(chemistry)","Solution","IUPAC","Particle_aggregation","Coalescence_(chemistry)","Colloid_chemistry","Particulate","Settling","Filtration","Emulsion","Civil_engineering","Earth_sciences","Structure","Clay","Slurry","Biology","Curd","Cheese","Rennet","Micelle","Einstein_relation_%28kinetic_theory%29","Gaithersburg,_Maryland","Water_purification","Drinking_water","Sewage_treatment","Viscosity","Dispersant","Anionic","Polymers","Clay","Polyphosphate","Lignosulfonates","Quebracho_tannin","Activated_sludge","Submersible_mixer","Aggregation_(disambiguation)","Algaculture","Clay-water_interaction","Drilling_mud","Isoelectric_point","Lamella_clarifier","Ostwald_ripening","Seawater","Sedimentation","Soil_structure","Yeast_flocculation","Smoluchowski_coagulation_equation","Deposition_(geology)","Depletion_force"]}
