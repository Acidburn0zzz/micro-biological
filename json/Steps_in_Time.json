Although lasting\njust two years and a half, King had five UK Top 40 hit songs, including two Top\n10 hits: \"Love & Pride\" (#2), the re-release of their debut single from the\nfirst album, and \"Alone Without You\" (#8) from their second album [[Bitter Sweet\n(King album)|Bitter Sweet]] (after that, the lead singer Paul King went on to\nstart a brief solo career, releasing one more album, [[Joy (Paul King\nalbum)|Joy]]). After the first single \"Love & Pride\", a second single, \"Won't\nYou Hold My Hand Now\" was released, which got to Number 24 in the UK. A live\nvideoclip was also released for \"Trouble\", and aired by MTV, but the song never\ncame out as a single.\n\nThe tape edition of the LP was soon re-released with eight bonus tracks,\nincluding B-Sides, previously unreleased songs and some remixes, among which\nwere \"Love & Pride (Body & Soul Mix)\" and \"Won't You Hold My Hand Now (Heavy\nTimes Mix)\".\n\n","linknr":174,"url":"Steps_in_Time","recorded":1376425024,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_in_Time","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Studio_album","/wiki/King_(band)","/wiki/1984_in_music","/wiki/Park_Gate","/wiki/The_Manor","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/New_Wave_music","/wiki/Vinyl_record","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Columbia_Records","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Richard_James_Burgess","/wiki/King_(band)","/wiki/Bitter_Sweet_(King_album)","/wiki/1984_in_music","/wiki/Debut_album","/wiki/Coventry","/wiki/King_(band)","/wiki/Richard_James_Burgess","/wiki/Columbia_Records","/wiki/UK_Top_40","/wiki/Top_40","/wiki/Single_(music)","/wiki/Bitter_Sweet_(King_album)","/wiki/Lead_singer","/wiki/Paul_King_(musician,_MJ)","/wiki/Solo_(music)","/wiki/Joy_(Paul_King_album)","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Recorded_live_track","/wiki/MTV","/wiki/Long_playing","/wiki/Bonus_track","/wiki/B-Side","/wiki/Remix","#Track_listing","#LP","#MC","#Singles","#Videoclips","#Credits","#Line-up","#Production","#Recording.2C_mixing_and_cut_studios","#Staff","#Release_details","#References","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&veaction=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/Love_%26_Pride","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&veaction=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&veaction=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&veaction=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&veaction=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=edit&section=7","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&veaction=edit&section=7","/wiki/Paul_King_(musician,_MJ)","/wiki/Singing","/wiki/Keyboard_(instrument)","/wiki/Bass_guitar","/wiki/Guitar","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=edit&section=8","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&veaction=edit&section=8","/wiki/Richard_James_Burgess","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Drum_kit","/wiki/Engineering","/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Andrew_Jackson_(recording_engineer)","/wiki/Flood","/wiki/Engineering","/wiki/Engineering","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=edit&section=9","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&veaction=edit&section=9","/wiki/Park_Gate","/wiki/The_Manor","/wiki/Recording_studio","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=edit&section=10","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&veaction=edit&section=10","/wiki/Management","/wiki/Sleeve","/wiki/Photography","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=edit&section=11","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&veaction=edit&section=11","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Columbia_Records","/wiki/Vinyl_record","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Compact_Cassette","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=edit&section=12","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&veaction=edit&section=12","http://www.discogs.com/release/378081","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&oldid=556617353","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1984_debut_albums","/wiki/Category:King_(band)_albums","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hAudio_microformats","/wiki/Category:Album_infoboxes_lacking_a_cover","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Steps+in+Time&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Steps+in+Time","/wiki/Steps_in_Time","/wiki/Talk:Steps_in_Time","#","/wiki/Steps_in_Time","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Steps_in_Time&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Mai
