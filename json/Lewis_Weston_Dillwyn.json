His father, a Pennsylvanian Quaker had returned\nto Britain in 1777 during Philadelphia's worst period in the American War of\nIndependence and settled at Higham Lodge, Walthamstow, Essex, UK. William\nDillwyn was a vociferous anti-slavery campaigner and toured England and South\nWales in his work for the Anti-Slavery Committee. William Dillwyn was related to\nGeorge Haynes through the Emlen and Physick families in Philadelphia and it is\nlikely that the opportunity to buy the Cambrian Pottery, Swansea, Glamorganshire\nfrom George Haynes came about through these family connections in America.\n\nWilliam's letters to his daughter Suzanna are held by the Library Company in\nPhiladelphia and stored at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. These letters\nshow that the factory was bought by William to keep Lewis active while the\nlatter was suffering from gout. The highlight of this period of production of\nSwansea Pottery was the opening by Lewis Weston Dillwyn and George Haynes of the\nCambrian Company, the Swansea Potteries London Warehouse on Fleet Street which\noperated between 1806-1807. See The Cambrian Company, Swansea Pottery In\nLondon 1806-1808, Jonathan Gray 2012 In 1814 the pottery took over the\nworkforce of the Nantgarw Pottery and began to make porcelain.\n\nLewis Weston Dillwyn however was also renowned for his published works on botany\nand conchology, including his work The British Confervae an illustrated study of\nBritish freshwater algae, published 1809. Dillwyn is credited with discovering\nseveral species of the Conferva genus. Among the botanical illustrators of The\nBritish Confervae are the artists William Jackson Hooker, Ellen Hutchins and\nWilliam Weston Young. He was elected in 1804 as a Fellow of the Royal Society\n\nIn 1817 he temporarily retired from the pottery. In 1818 he became High Sheriff\nof Glamorgan and was elected to the First Reformed Parliament in 1834 as MP for\nGlamorganshire. He bought Sketty Hall near Swansea and was elected Mayor of\nSwansea in 1839. http://thepeerage.com/p37112.htm Dillwyn was also\none of the founders of the Royal Institution of South Wales and its first\nPresident, and in 1840 he published a short history of Swansea.\n\nHe married Mary Adams, the daughter of Colonel John Llewelyn of Penllergaer,\nLlangyfelach in 1807. They had six children, including the noted photographer\nJohn Dillwyn Llewelyn (1810â1882) and Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn, who became MP\nfor Swansea.\n\nHe died in Sketty Hall, Swansea, in 1855.\n\n.\n","linknr":149,"url":"Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn","recorded":1376425414,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Walthamstow","/w/index.php?title=William_Dillwyn&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Quaker","/wiki/American_War_of_Independence","/wiki/Cambrian_Pottery","/wiki/Swansea","/wiki/Glamorganshire","/wiki/George_Haynes","/wiki/Gout","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Nantgarw_Pottery","/wiki/Porcelain","/wiki/Botany","/wiki/Conchology","/wiki/Species","/wiki/Conferva","/wiki/Genus","/wiki/William_Jackson_Hooker","/wiki/Ellen_Hutchins","/wiki/William_Weston_Young","/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Glamorgan","/wiki/Sketty_Hall","#cite_note-2","/wiki/John_Dillwyn_Llewelyn","/wiki/Lewis_Llewelyn_Dillwyn","/wiki/List_of_botanists_by_author_abbreviation","/wiki/Author_citation_(botany)","/wiki/Botanical_name","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Lithopoma_gibberosa","/wiki/Snail","/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://thepeerage.com/p37112.htm","#cite_ref-3","http://www.ipni.org/ipni/advAuthorSearch.do?find_abbreviation=Dillwyn","/wiki/International_Plant_Names_Index","http://thepeerage.com/p37112.htm","http://auden.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I9739&ged=auden-bicknell.ged","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn&veaction=edit&section=3","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Sir_Christopher_Cole","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Glamorganshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Edwin_Wyndham-Quin,_3rd_Earl_of_Dunraven_and_Mount-Earl","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/25385244","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn&oldid=562874205","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Botanists_with_author_abbreviations","/wiki/Category:British_Quakers","/wiki/Category:Conchologists","/wiki/Category:Teuthologists","/wiki/Category:Ceramics_manufacturers_of_Wales","/wiki/Category:1778_births","/wiki/Category:1855_deaths","/wiki/Category:High_Sheriffs_of_Glamorgan","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_for_Welsh_constituencies","/wiki/Category:Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Linnean_Society_of_London","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1832%E2%80%931835","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1835%E2%80%931837","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_March_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Lewis+Weston+Dillwyn&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Lewis+Weston+Dillwyn","/wiki/Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn","/wiki/Talk:Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn","#","/wiki/Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn","/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Weston_Dillwyn&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedire
