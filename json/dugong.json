It is the only\nliving representative of the once-diverse family Dugongidae; its closest modern\nrelative, Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas), was hunted to extinction in\nthe 18th century. It is also the only sirenian in its range, which spans the\nwaters of at least 37 countries throughout the Indo-Pacific, though the majority\nof dugongs live in the northern waters of Australia between Shark Bay and\nMoreton Bay. The dugong is the only strictly marine herbivorous mammal, as all\nspecies of manatee use fresh water to some degree.\n\nLike all modern sirenians, the dugong has a body with no dorsal fin or hind\nlimbs, instead possessing paddle-like forelimbs used to manoeuvre. It is easily\ndistinguished from the manatees by its fluked, dolphin-like tail, but also\npossesses a unique skull and teeth. The dugong is heavily dependent on\nseagrasses for subsistence and is thus restricted to the coastal habitats where\nthey grow, with the largest dugong concentrations typically occurring in wide,\nshallow, protected areas such as bays, mangrove channels and the lee sides of\nlarge inshore islands. Its snout is sharply downturned, an adaptation for\ngrazing and uprooting benthic seagrasses.\n\nThe dugong has been hunted for thousands of years for its meat and oil.\nTraditional hunting has great cultural significance throughout its range. The\ndugong's current distribution is reduced and disjunct, and many populations are\nclose to extinction. The IUCN lists the dugong as a species vulnerable to\nextinction, while the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species\nlimits or bans the trade of derived products. Despite being legally protected in\nmany countries, the main causes of population decline remain anthropogenic and\ninclude hunting, habitat degradation, and fishing-related fatalities. With its\nlong lifespan of 70 years or more, and slow rate of reproduction, the dugong is\nespecially vulnerable to extinction.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"dugong","recorded":1376428038,"links":[],"instances":["island","archipelago","anatomy","anatomy","kenya","geography","region"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sirenians","Fauna of Micronesia","Mammals of Africa","Mammals of Southwest Asia","Mammals of the United Arab Emirates","Fauna of the Indian Ocean","Mammals of Australia","Megafauna of Australia","Megafauna of Eurasia","Megafauna of Africa","Vulnerable fauna of Australia","Monotypic mammal genera","Malay words and phrases","EDGE species","Animals described in 1776","Mammals of Malaysia","Mammals of the Philippines","Mammals of Indonesia","Fauna of Israel"],"headings":["Etymology and taxonomy","Anatomy and morphology","Distribution and habitat","Ecology and life history","Importance to humans","Conservation","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["channel","geography"],["nail","anatomy"],["pinna","anatomy"],["saurashtra","region"],["epi","island"],["solomon_islands","archipelago"],["channel","geography"],["wildlife_act","kenya"]],"members":["epi","solomon_islands","pinna","nail","wildlife_act","channel","saurashtra"],"related":["Marsa_Alam","Animal","Chordata","Mammal","Sirenia","Dugongidae","John_Edward_Gray","George_Gaylord_Simpson","Bernard_Germain_de_Lacépède","Philipp_Ludwig_Statius_Muller","Marine_mammal","Manatee","Sirenia","Dugongidae","Steller's_sea_cow","Extinction","Indo-Pacific","Australia","Shark_Bay","Moreton_Bay","Seawater","Dorsal_fin","Hind_limb","Forelimb","Seagrass","Bays","Mangrove","Channel_(geography)","Windward_and_leeward","Inshore","Islands","Snout","Grazing","Benthic_zone","Meat","Oil","World_Conservation_Union","Convention_on_International_Trade_in_Endangered_Species","Human_impact_on_the_environment","Tagalog_language","Malay_language","Alfred_A._Knopf","Dugongidae","Sirenia","Manatee","Philipp_Ludwig_Statius_Müller","Carolus_Linnaeus","Type_species","Bernard_Germain_de_Lacépède","John_Edward_Gray","George_Gaylord_Simpson","Marine_mammal","Elephant","Monophyly","Hyrax","Aardvark","Eutheria","Eocene","Tethys_Ocean","Steller's_sea_cow","Miocene","Mitochondrial_DNA","Southeast_Asia","Timor","Moreton_Bay","Western_Australia","Northern_Territory","Algae","Tactition","Cooperative_Research_Centre","Great_Barrier_Reef","Nail_(anatomy)","University_of_Michigan","Pinna_(anatomy)","Nipple","Testes","Genital","Navel","Anus","Lungs","Kidneys","Premaxilla","Vertebrae","Incisor","Tusk","Pachyostosis","Animal","Smithsonian_Institution","Ballast_tank","Saurashtra_(region)","India","Egypt","Equator","Potamogetonaceae","Hydrocharitaceae","Hong_Kong","Mauritius","Taiwan","Cambodia","Japan","Philippines","Vietnam","East_Africa","Red_Sea","Persian_Gulf","Gulf_of_Kutch","India","Maldives","Laccadive_Islands","Gulf_of_Mannar","Palk_Strait","Sri_Lanka","Nansei_Shoto","Taiwan","Okinawa","Center_for_Biological_Diversity","Epi_(island)","Vanuatu","China","Hainan","Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands","Philippines","Gulf_of_Thailand","Straits_of_Johor","Borneo","Malay_archipelago","Solomon_Islands_(archipelago)","New_Caledonia","Vanuatu","Palau","Australia","Shark_Bay","Western_Australia","Moreton_Bay","Queensland","Ashmore_reef","Northern_Territory","Gulf_of_Carpentaria","Torres_Strait","New_Guinea","Great_Barrier_Reef","Queensland","Hervey_Bay","Moreton_Bay","Channel_(geography)","Windward_and_leeward","Stingray","Helminth","Cryptosporidium","Queensland","Lekking","Sydney","Cooktown","Sea_cows","Algae","Herbivore","Invertebrates","Jellyfish","Sea_squirts","Shellfish","Polychaetes","Seral_community","Estrus","Lekking","Gestation","Malaysia","Mermaid","Tambun_Cave","Ipoh","Perak","Malaysia","Renaissance","Baroque","Wunderkammer","Fiji_mermaid","Sideshow","Australian_aborigine","Torres_Strait_Islanders","Kenya","Aphrodisiac","Papua_New_Guinea","Old_Testament","Tabernacle","IUCN_Red_List","CITES","Southeast_Asia","Kenya","Wildlife_Act_(Kenya)","Mozambique","Egypt","Gulf_of_Aqaba","United_Arab_Emirates","Bahrain","Drift_net","People's_Republic_of_China","Papua_New_Guinea","Nature_Conservation_Act","Human_impact_on_the_environment","Shark_nets","Hainan","Oil_spill","Land_reclamation","Okinawa","United_States","Henoko","Uranium","Cyclone","Flood","Wastewater","Toba_Aquarium","Toba,_Mie","Underwater_World,_Singapore","Sydney_Aquarium"]}
