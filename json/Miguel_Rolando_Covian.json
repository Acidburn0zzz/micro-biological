{"cursor":"6716","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Miguel Rolando Covian' (1913â1992), was an Argentine-Brazilian physiologist,\nmedical educator and writer.\n\nCovian was born in Rufino, Santa FÃ© Province, Argentina, on September 7, 1913.\nHe studied at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Buenos Aires, where,\nwhile a student, he worked also as a teaching assistant in the Chair of\nPhysiology. He graduated in 1942 and soon thereafter started a full-time career\nin research on Physiology, initially in collaboration with Bernardo Houssay, the\ngreat Argentine physiologist, who later was awarded with the 1947 Nobel Prize in\nMedicine and Physiology for his investigations on the interaction between the\nhypophysis and the pancreas in the control of glucose metabolism. From 1945 to\n1948, Covian worked at the Institute of Experimental Biology and Medicine of\nBuenos Aires, a private research institution which Houssay and co-workers had\nfounded in 1944, due to his dismissal from the University due to political\npersecution by the dictatorial regime of Juan PerÃ³n. There, he worked also with\nanother eminent physiologist, Eduardo Braun-MenÃ©ndez, and presented his doctoral\ndissertation, in 1948.\n\nAfter his doctorate, Covian went for a post-doctoral fellowship by the\nRockefeller Foundation, at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA. There\nhe worked on the physiology of hemidecorticated animals and neurovegetative\ncontrol, with several important physiologists, such as Phillip Bard, Carl\nRichter and Vernon Mountcastle. He returned three years later to Argentina, to\ncontinue his participation at the Institute of Experimental Biology and\nMedicine, where, in 1952, he established the first experimental laboratory of\nneurophysiology of Argentina.\n\nIn 1955, Covian was already well known internationally for his research on the\nneurophysiology of the limbic system. He accepted an invitation from Dr.\nZeferino Vaz to join the faculty of the recently founded School of Medicine of\nRibeirÃ£o Preto of the University of SÃ£o Paulo, at RibeirÃ£o Preto, SÃ£o Paulo,\nBrazil, as the chairman of the Department of Physiology, a post he held until\n1974 and from 1978 to 1982. Under Covian's able and humane leadership, the\nDepartment would grow to become one of the main excellence centers of research\nand education in Latin America, with an excellent scientific staff, with\nprominent researchers such as Eduardo Krieger, Renato Migliorini, CÃ©sar Timo-\nIaria, JosÃ© Antunes Rodrigues, JosÃ© VenÃ¢ncio Pereira Leite and fellow Argentines\nMaria Carmelo Lico, AndrÃ©s Negro-Vilar and Ricardo F. Marseillan. Covian was\ninvolved in all aspects of scientific and educational progress in the\nphysiological sciences. It was there too that Covian founded the first Brazilian\nlaboratory of neurophysiology.\n\nCovian was extremely active as a scientific leader. He was one of the founders\nand a president of the Brazilian Society of Physiology. He also was a strong\nforce behind the graduate programs of the School of Medicine of RibeirÃ£o Preto,\nand an innovator in the use of new approaches to the teaching of physiology. He\nwas active in the editorial boards of several international scientific\njournals, such as \"Physiology & Behavior\" and the monograph series of \"Progress\nin Brain Research\", a member to several international committees, the\nInternational Brain Research Organization and the Latin American Federation of\nPhysiological Sciences.\n\nCovian's main achievement in neurophysiology was the systematic study, with a\nlarge group of collaborators, of the neural basis of thirst, of neuroendocrine\nregulation of hydroelectrolytic homeostasis, and of appetitive behavior, i.e.,\nthe behavior which permit animals to seek and to ingest particular foodstuffs or\ndiet components, an activity which depends on many external and internal\nfactors. The animal model used by Covian's group was the selective ingestion of\nwater versus salt water in albino Norwegian rats, which they investigated with\nmany approaches and tools, such as after lesions and stimulations of the central\nnervous system, measurement of metabolic activity, manipulation of the activity\nof the endocrine system, the effect of several kinds of drugs, etc. He also\nstudied the role of the limbic system (particularly the septal area) on many\nbehaviors and functions, such as the control of blood pressure, the\nneuroendocrine regulation of reproductive behavior, etc.\n\nProf. Miguel Covian was also a humanist, deeply interested in the history and\nphilosophy of science, history of medicine, epistemology, religion, classical\nmusic and erudite art.\n\nHe retired at the mandatory age of 70, as a professor emeritus, but continued to\nappear regularly his office in the department. Honored by his many colleagues,\npupils and friends, Miguel Covian died on February 5, 1992, following\ncomplications of a stroke.\n","linknr":161,"url":"Miguel_Rolando_Covian","recorded":1376425434,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Miguel_Rolando_Covian&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Miguel_Rolando_Covian&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Argentina","/wiki/Brazil","/wiki/Rufino,_Santa_Fe","/wiki/Santa_F%C3%A9_Province","/wiki/Argentina","/wiki/University_of_Buenos_Aires","/wiki/Physiology","/wiki/Bernardo_Houssay","/wiki/Nobel_Prize","/wiki/Hypophysis","/wiki/Pancreas","/wiki/Glucose","/wiki/Metabolism","/wiki/Institute_of_Experimental_Biology_and_Medicine_of_Buenos_Aires","/wiki/Juan_Per%C3%B3n","/wiki/Eduardo_Braun-Men%C3%A9ndez","/wiki/Rockefeller_Foundation","/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University","/wiki/Baltimore","/wiki/USA","/w/index.php?title=Phillip_Bard&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Carl_Richter&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Vernon_Mountcastle","/wiki/Neurophysiology","/wiki/Limbic_system","/wiki/Zeferino_Vaz","/wiki/Faculdade_de_Medicina_de_Ribeir%C3%A3o_Preto","/wiki/University_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo","/wiki/Ribeir%C3%A3o_Preto","/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_(state)","/wiki/Brazil","/wiki/Leadership","/wiki/Latin_America","/wiki/Eduardo_Krieger","/wiki/Renato_Migliorini","/w/index.php?title=C%C3%A9sar_Timo-Iaria&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Antunes_Rodrigues&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Ven%C3%A2ncio_Pereira_Leite&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Maria_Carmelo_Lico&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Andr%C3%A9s_Negro-Vilar&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Ricardo_F._Marseillan&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Brazilian_Society_of_Physiology","/w/index.php?title=Progress_in_Brain_Research&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/International_Brain_Research_Organization","/w/index.php?title=Latin_American_Federation_of_Physiological_Sciences&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Thirst","/wiki/Neuroendocrine","/wiki/Homeostasis","/wiki/Appetitive_behavior","/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)","/wiki/Animal_model","/wiki/Water","/wiki/Brine","/wiki/Norwegian_rat","/wiki/Central_nervous_system","/wiki/Metabolism","/wiki/Endocrine_system","/wiki/Medication","/wiki/Limbic_system","/wiki/Septal_area","/wiki/Blood_pressure","/wiki/Reproductive_behavior","/wiki/Humanism","/wiki/History_of_science","/wiki/Philosophy_of_science","/wiki/History_of_medicine","/wiki/Epistemology","/wiki/Religion","/wiki/European_classical_music","/wiki/Art","/wiki/Professor_emeritus","/wiki/Stroke","/w/index.php?title=Miguel_Rolando_Covian&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Miguel_Rolando_Covian&action=edit&section=2","http://www.pcarp.usp.br/acsi/anterior/748/mat3.htm","/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot","https://www.cle.unicamp.br/arquivoshistoricos/emiguelcovian.pdf","/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Miguel_Rolando_Covian&oldid=510432407","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1913_births","/wiki/Category:1992_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Santa_Fe_Province","/wiki/Category:Argentine_physicians","/wiki/Category:Argentine_scientists","/wiki/Category:Brazilian_people_of_Argentine_descent","/wiki/Category:Brazilian_scientists","/wiki/Category:Brazilian_neuroscientists","/wiki/Category:Brazilian_physiologists","/wiki/Category:Brazilian_physicians","/wiki/Category:Johns_Hopkins_University_faculty","/wiki/Category:University_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_faculty","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_dead_external_links","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_dead_external_links_from_January_2010","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Miguel+Rolando+Covian&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Miguel+Rolando+Covian","/wiki/Miguel_Rolando_Covian","/wiki/Talk:Miguel_Rolando_Covian","#","/wiki/Miguel_Rolando_Covian","/w/index.php?title=Miguel_Rolando_Covian&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Miguel_Rolando_Covian&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Feature
