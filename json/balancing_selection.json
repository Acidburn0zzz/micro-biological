{"cursor":"11861","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Balancing selection' refers to a number of selective processes by which\nmultiple alleles (different versions of a gene) are actively maintained in the\ngene pool of a population at frequencies above that of [[gene mutation]]. This\nusually happens when the heterozygotes for the alleles under consideration have\na higher adaptive value than the homozygote. King R.C. Stansfield W.D. &\nMulligan P.K. 2006.

All modern\nresearch has shown that this significant genetic variation is ubiquitous in\npanmictic populations. It is a genetic expression of the field experience of\nDarwin, Wallace and others, that natural populations in the wild are\nextraordinarily varied (though not all such variation is of genetic origin).\n\nThere are several mechanisms (which are not exclusive within any given\npopulation) by which balancing selection works to maintain polymorphism. The two\nmajor and most studied are heterozygote advantage and frequency-dependent\nselection.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"balancing_selection","recorded":1376427552,"links":[],"instances":["biology","biology","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Selection"],"headings":["Mechanisms of balancing selection","More complex examples","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["polymorphism","biology"],["locus","genetics"],["fitness","biology"],["cline","biology"]],"members":["fitness","polymorphism","cline","locus"],"related":["Natural_selection","Allele","Gene","Gene_pool","Population","Heterozygotes","Homozygote","Polymorphism_(biology)","Panmixis","Charles_Darwin","Alfred_Russel_Wallace","Heterozygote_advantage","Locus_(genetics)","Fitness_(biology)","Sickle-cell_disease","Heredity","Red_blood_cells","Hemoglobin","Gene","Sickle_cell_trait","Malarial_parasite","Prey_switching","Multiple_alleles","Epistasis","Song_thrush","Apostatic_selection","Supergene","Theodosius_Dobzhansky","California","Theophilus_Painter","Polytene","Chromosomal_inversions","Hardy-Weinberg_equilibrium","Insect_migration","Cline_(biology)","Gatlinburg,_Tennessee","Tennessee","Directional_selection","Disruptive_selection","Stabilizing_selection"]}
