It\nwas originally released in late 2005 as a rough mix for free download from the\nband's site. Carol Heller originally sang backing vocals in this version of the\nsong, but the backing vocals were re-recorded for the final album version. The\nCDs came free with merchandise purchased from the band's site. The album version\nhas a new drum track, as well as an extra verse at the end of the song, (Please\nunderstand... Lay rotting where I fall. I'm dead from bad intentions. Suffocated\nand embalmed and now all our dreams are cashed in. You swore you wouldn't lose\nthen lost your brain, you make a sound that feels like pain. So please\nunderstand, this isn't just goodbye, this is I can't stand you.) that was not on\nthe limited edition single version.\n\nOn October 24, Travis Barker (drummer from the band) told Ultimate-Guitar.com on\n\"No, It Isn't\": :I have a snare and I just like lay real back, and just play\naccent things here and there. Originally that was all acoustic and I never\nwanted to put drums in. I always thought like what Mark was saying and the\nwords, what he was talking about, just stood on its own. There didn't need to be\nanything else behind it besides him and that acoustic guitar. Then I kind of got\noutvoted. They like drums in it, so I was like, \"I'm down with it. If it makes\nthe song better, I'm gonna do it.\" {{cite web\n| title = Therapy Session Of Travis Barker\n|work=Ultimate-Guitar.com |first=Rosen |last=Steven\n| url=http://ultimate-\n| guitar.com/interviews/interviews/therapy_session_of_travis_barker.html\n| accessdate= 24 October 2006 }}\n\nThe song was available for download on their official site on December 13, 2005,\nwhich happened to be the day the ex-bandmate from Blink-182, Tom DeLonge was\nscheduled to release material from his new band, Angels & Airwaves, and also his\n30th birthday. Hoppus has stated that he didn't mean for that coincidence to\nhappen, it was a decision made purely by +44 management.\n\nUpon the song's release, allegations were made that the song was about previous\nbandmate, Tom Delonge. After a period of time responding to the claim with \"No,\nit isn't\" (hence the title), Hoppus eventually admitted that it was directed\ntoward DeLonge.\n","linknr":131,"url":"No_It_Isn't","recorded":1376424753,"links":["/w/index.php?title=No,_It_Isn%27t&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=No,_It_Isn%27t&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No,_It_Isn%27t","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=No_It_Isn%27t&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Not_it_isn%27t.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a0/Not_it_isn%27t.jpg/220px-Not_it_isn%27t.jpg","/wiki/Single_(music)","/wiki/%2B44_(band)","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Indie_rock","/wiki/Alternative_rock","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Interscope_Records","/wiki/Songwriter","/wiki/Mark_Hoppus","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Mark_Hoppus","/wiki/Travis_Barker","/wiki/Mark_Hoppus","/wiki/%2B44_(band)","/wiki/Carol_Heller","/wiki/Travis_Barker","#cite_note-ultimate-guitar-1","/wiki/Blink-182","/wiki/Tom_DeLonge","/wiki/Angels_%26_Airwaves","/wiki/%2B44","/wiki/Tom_Delonge","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=No,_It_Isn%27t&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=No,_It_Isn%27t&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-ultimate-guitar_1-0","http://ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/therapy_session_of_travis_barker.html","/wiki/Template:%2B44","/wiki/Template_talk:%2B44","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:%2B44&action=edit","/wiki/%2B44_(band)","/wiki/Mark_Hoppus","/wiki/Travis_Barker","/wiki/Shane_Gallagher","/wiki/Craig_Fairbaugh","/wiki/%2B44_(band)","/wiki/When_Your_Heart_Stops_Beating","/wiki/Lycanthrope_(song)","/wiki/When_Your_Heart_Stops_Beating_(song)","/wiki/%2B44_discography","/wiki/Blink-182","/wiki/Expensive_Taste","/wiki/Mercy_Killers","/wiki/The_Nervous_Return","/wiki/Transplants_(band)","/wiki/ITunes_Foreign_Exchange","/wiki/Box_Car_Racer","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=No,_It_Isn%27t&oldid=566503398","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:2005_songs","/wiki/Category:%2B44_songs","/wiki/Category:Rock_ballads","/wiki/Category:Interscope_Records_singles","/wiki/Category:Songs_written_by_Mark_Hoppus","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_November_2010","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=No%2C+It+Isn%27t&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=No%2C+It+Isn%27t","/wiki/No,_It_Isn%27t","/wiki/Talk:No,_It_Isn%27t","#","/wiki/No,_It_Isn%27t","/w/index.php?title=No,_It_Isn%27t&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=No,_It_Isn%27t&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=No,_It_Isn%27t&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/No,_It_Isn%27t","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/No,_It_Isn%27t","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=No,_It_Isn%27t&oldid=566503398","/w/index.php?title=No,_It_Isn%27t&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2306426","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=No%2C_It_Isn%27t&id=566503398","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=No%2C+It+Isn%27t","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=No%2C+It+Isn%27t&oldid=566503398&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=No,_It_Isn%27t&printable=yes","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/No,_It_Isn%27t","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/No,_It_Isn%27t","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/No,_It_Isn%27t","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/No,_It_Isn%27t","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2306426#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativ
