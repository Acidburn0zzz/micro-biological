{"cursor":"7126","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Oxygenated' chemical compounds contain oxygen as a part of their chemical\nstructure. The term usually refers to oxygenated fuels. Oxygenates are usually\nemployed as gasoline additives to reduce carbon monoxide that is created during\nthe burning of the fuel.\n\nThe oxygenate MTBE has been found to have contaminated groundwater, mostly\nthrough leaks in underground gasoline storage tanks. In 2004, California and New\nYork banned MTBE, generally replacing it with ethanol. Several other states\nstarted switching soon afterward.\n\nThe oxygenates commonly used are either alcohols or ethers:\n* Alcohols: ** Methanol (MeOH) ** Ethanol (EtOH) ** Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) **\n  ''n''-butanol (BuOH) ** Gasoline grade ''t''-butanol (GTBA)\n* Ethers: ** Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) ** Tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME)\n  ** Tertiary hexyl methyl ether (THEME) ** Ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE) **\n  Tertiary amyl ethyl ether (TAEE) ** Diisopropyl ether (DIPE)\n\nIn the United States, preferential regulatory and tax treatment of ethanol (and\nmethanol) automotive fuels introduces complexities beyond the energy balance\ninherent in and the engineering merits of the fuels themselves. North American\nautomakers have in 2006 and 2007 enthusiastically promoted a blend of 85%\nethanol and 15% gasoline, marketed as E85, and their flex-fuel vehicles, e.g.\nGM's \"[http://www.livegreengoyellow.com/ Live Green, Go Yellow]\" campaign. The\napparent motivation for this is the nature of U.S. Corporate Average Fuel\nEconomy (CAFE) standards, which give an effective 54% fuel efficiency bonus to\nvehicles capable of running on 85% alcohol blends over vehicles not adapted to\nrun on 85% alcohol blends,. {{cite web\n| url=http://frwebgate1.access.gpo.gov/cgi-\n| bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=553329296936+2+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve title=Code\n| of Federal Regulations, title 40, part 600, section 600.510-93\n| publisher=United States Government Printing Office date=1 August 2005\n}} This regulatory artificiality is quite valuable to the North American\nauto manufacturers in avoiding fines for failing to meet CAFE fuel economy\nstandards imposed upon each manufacturer's car and light truck fleets.\n{{cite web\n| url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/new-cars/news/2006/ethanol-10-\n| 06/overview/1006_ethanol_ov1_1.htm title=The Ethanol Myth date=October 2006\n| publisher=Consumer Reports magazine\n}} In addition to this auto manufacturer-driven impetus for 85% alcohol\nblends, the United States Environmental Protection Agency had authority to\nmandate that minimum proportions of oxygenates be added to automotive gasoline\non regional and seasonal basis from 1992 until 2006 in an attempt to reduce air\npollution, in particular ground-level ozone and smog. As a consequence, much\ngasoline sold in the United States is blended with up to 10% of an unspecified\noxygenating agent. This product is known formally as oxygenated fuel and often\n(but not entirely correctly, as there are federally mandated reformulated\ngasolines without oxygenate) as reformulated gasoline. Groundwater contamination\nscares and the State of California's ban of the substance as a gasoline additive\nhas caused methyl tert(iary)-butyl ether (MTBE) to be displaced by ethanol as\nthe most popular fuel oxygenate in the United States.\n\nMany motorists in the U.S. did not welcome oxygenated gasoline because of its\nreduced energy density resulting in increased fuel consumption and because of\nfears of damage to cars, particularly to older cars. Alcohol (particularly\nmethanol) fuel blends were expected to cause chemical damage to fuel system\nmaterials not designed to withstand exposure to alcohols, to increase water\ncontamination due to alcohols' co-solvent properties, and via alcohols' solvent\naction loosening fixed fuel system deposits thus causing free-moving particulate\ncontamination and clogging of various components. Experience with oxygenated\nfuels has shown little widespread deleterious mechanical effects, but oxygenated\nfuels have resulted in increased fuel consumption and often higher fuel prices.\nAlthough market conditions vary widely, ethanol is generally more expensive on a\nvolumetric basis (and unquestionably more expensive on an energy content basis)\nthan the gasoline with which it is blended. Refining and distribution\ncomplexities associated with regionally specific oxygenated 'boutique gas'\nblends also has significantly raised gasoline prices in parts of the United\nStates, particularly in California. Air pollution benefits from oxygenated fuels\nhave thus far been difficult to quantify and to attribute to oxygenated fuel,\nbut undoubtedly small.\n\nThe promotion of, Federal subsidy for, and high import tariffs protecting\ndomestic production of ethanol motor fuel and the Federal mandate for oxygenated\ngasoline are essentially political phenomena. The principal driver in promoting\nE85 is the North American auto industry's need to avoid CAFE fines. Lobbying by\nAmerican corn producers and agribusiness has done much to get the fuel alcohol\nindustry its present subsidized and protected status. Archer Daniels Midland,\nthe biggest ethanol producer in the United States, is prominent among these\nlobbyists. Advocates for wheat, corn and sugar growers have succeeded in their\nattempts to lobby for regulatory intervention encouraging adoption of\nethanol, {{cite web\n| url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2007-04-10-renewable-\n| usat_N.htm title=U.S. seeks to boost ethanol, biodiesel date=10 April 2007\n| publisher=USA Today\n}} stimulating debate over who the major beneficiaries of increased use of\nethanol would be. Some researchers have warned that ethanol produced from\nagricultural feedstocks will cause a global food shortage, {{cite web\n| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18551000/ title=U.N.: Not so fast with\n| ethanol, other biofuels date=2007-05-08 publisher=MSNBC accessdate=2007-05-\n| 21}}\n contributing to starvation in the third world.\n\nMost forms of automobile racing that require the use of gasoline as fuel (as\nopposed to higher-energy blended fuels or straight alcohols) prohibit the use of\noxygenate compounds in fuels, as they can allow higher fuel burn than the engine\nintake restrictions are designed to permit. Prior to the 2007 Daytona 500, for\nexample, NASCAR driver Michael Waltrip and his team were heavily penalized when\nevidence of an unspecified oxygenate compound was found in the car's intake\nmanifold during inspections.\n","linknr":140,"url":"Oxygenate","recorded":1376416227,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Oxygenate&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Oxygenate&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenate","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Oxygen","/wiki/Fuel","/wiki/Gasoline_additive","/wiki/Carbon_monoxide","/wiki/MTBE","/wiki/California","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/Ethanol","/wiki/Alcohol","/wiki/Ether","/wiki/Methanol","/wiki/Ethanol","/wiki/Isopropyl_alcohol","/wiki/N-Butanol","/wiki/Tert-Butanol","/wiki/Methyl_tert-butyl_ether","/wiki/Tertiary_amyl_methyl_ether","/w/index.php?title=Tertiary_hexyl_methyl_ether&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/ETBE","/w/index.php?title=Tertiary_amyl_ethyl_ether&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Diisopropyl_ether","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/E85","/wiki/General_Motors","http://www.livegreengoyellow.com/","/wiki/Corporate_Average_Fuel_Economy","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","/wiki/Ground-level_ozone","/wiki/Smog","/wiki/California","/wiki/MTBE","/wiki/Ethanol","/wiki/Archer_Daniels_Midland","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Automobile_racing","/wiki/Intake","/wiki/2007_Daytona_500","/wiki/NASCAR","/wiki/Michael_Waltrip","/wiki/Intake_manifold","/w/index.php?title=Oxygenate&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Oxygenate&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Oxygenation_(disambiguation)","/w/index.php?title=Oxygenate&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Oxygenate&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://frwebgate1.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=553329296936+2+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve","#cite_ref-2","http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/new-cars/news/2006/ethanol-10-06/overview/1006_ethanol_ov1_1.htm","/wiki/Consumer_Reports","#cite_ref-3","http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2007-04-10-renewable-usat_N.htm","/wiki/USA_Today","#cite_ref-4","http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18551000/","/wiki/MSNBC","/w/index.php?title=Oxygenate&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Oxygenate&veaction=edit&section=3","http://www.efoa.org","http://www.epa.gov/otaq/oxygenate.htm","http://toxics.usgs.gov/definitions/fuel_oxygenates.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oxygenate&oldid=544058228","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Petroleum_products","/wiki/Category:Fuels","/wiki/Category:Oxygenates","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_November_2010","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Oxygenate&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Oxygenate","/wiki/Oxygenate","/wiki/Talk:Oxygenate","#","/wiki/Oxygenate","/w/index.php?title=Oxygenate&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Oxygenate&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Oxygenate&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Oxygenate","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Oxygenate","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Oxygenate&oldid=544058228","/w/index.php?title=Oxygenate&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7115966","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Oxygenate&id=544058228","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Oxygenate","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Oxygenate&oldid=544058228&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Oxygenate&printable=yes","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oksygenaty","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxigenato","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7115966#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/
