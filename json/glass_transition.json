ISO 11357-2: Plastics â\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) â Part 2: Determination of glass\ntransition temperature (1999).  An amorphous solid that exhibits a glass\ntransition is called a glass. Supercooling a viscous liquid into the glass state\nis called vitrification, from the Latin vitreum, \"glass\" via French vitrifier.\n\nDespite the massive change in the physical properties of a material through its\nglass transition, the transition is not itself a phase transition of any kind;\nrather it is a laboratory phenomenon extending over a range of temperature and\ndefined by one of several conventions. Such conventions include a constant cooling rate (20\nK/min) and a viscosity threshold of 10 12 PaÂ·s,\namong others. Upon cooling or heating through this glass-transition range, the\nmaterial also exhibits a smooth step in the thermal-expansion coefficient and in\nthe specific heat, with the location of these effects again being dependent on\nthe history of the material. However, the question of whether some\nphase transition underlies the glass transition is a matter of continuing\nresearch.\n\nThe 'glass-transition temperature' T g is always lower than the\nmelting temperature, T m, of the crystalline state of the material, if\none exists.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"glass_transition","recorded":1376428637,"links":[],"instances":["chemistry","materials_science","chemistry","glass","physics","physics","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Condensed matter physics","Cryobiology","Glass engineering and science","Glass physics","Phase transitions","Polymer chemistry","Proteins","Rubber properties","Threshold temperatures"],"headings":["Introduction","Transition temperature ''T''<sub>g</sub>","Kauzmann's paradox","The glass transition in specific materials","Mechanics of vitrification","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["relaxation","physics"],["annealing","glass"],["annealing","glass"],["poly(methyl_methacrylate"],["valency","chemistry"],["volatility","chemistry"],["elasticity","physics"],["order_and_disorder","physics"],["polymorphism","materials_science"]],"members":["volatility","polymorphism","valency","annealing","elasticity","order_and_disorder","relaxation"],"related":["Amorphous_solid","Semicrystalline","Rubber","International_Organization_for_Standardization","Glass","Viscous_liquid","Vitrification","Latin_language","French_language","Phase_transition","Pa·s","Thermal_expansion","Specific_heat","Melting_point","Order_of_magnitude","Glass","Freezing","Crystallization","Phase_transition","Polymers","Relaxation_(physics)","Annealing_(glass)","Thermodynamic_equilibrium","Time–temperature_superposition","Viscosity","Annealing_(glass)","Thermal_expansion","Heat_capacity","Glass","Differential_scanning_calorimetry","Dilatometer","Low-density_polyethylene","Tire","Polyvinylidene_fluoride","Polypropylene","Polyvinyl_fluoride","Polypropylene","Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate","Polyvinyl_acetate","Polychlorotrifluoroethylene","Polyethylene_terephthalate","Polyvinyl_chloride","Polyvinyl_alcohol","Polystyrene","Poly(methyl_methacrylate)","Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene","Polytetrafluoroethylene","Polycarbonate","Polynorbornene","Nylon","Polyethene","Polyethene","Chalcogenide","Chalcogenide","ZBLAN","Tellurium_dioxide","Soda-lime_glass","Fused_quartz","Heat_capacity","Glass_transition_temperature","Walter_Kauzmann","Phase_transition","Chemical_kinetics","Thermodynamic","Silica","Crystal","Tetrahedral","Amorphous_solid","Amorphous_solid","Covalent_bond","Boron","Sodium","Potassium","Calcium","Silica_glass","Valency_(chemistry)","Phosphorus","Polymer","Gibbs_free_energy","Activation_energy","Benzene","Ironing","Plasticizer","New_car_smell","Outgassing","Volatility_(chemistry)","Phthalates","Side_chain","Copolymer","Composite_material","Viscoelasticity","Silicone","Silly_Putty","Rubber","Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster","Space_Shuttle_Solid_Rocket_Booster","Fourier_series","Superposition_principle","Longitudinal_wave","Transverse_wave","Waves","Fluctuation","Thermal_motion","Longitudinal_wave","Phonon","Transverse_wave","Elasticity_(physics)","Shearing_stress","Plastic_deformation","Solid","Stiffness","Liquid","Viscous_flow","Shearing_force","Kinetic_theory_of_solids","Theory_of_elasticity","Liquid","Viscous_liquid","Vitrification","Thermal_conductivity","Compressibility","Thermal_expansion","Mean_free_path","Order_of_magnitude","Glass_transition_temperature","Heat_conduction","Dielectric","Scattering","Glasses","Ceramic_engineering","Thermal","Phonon","Electron","Electrical_resistance","Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity","Crystal","Scattering","Amplitude","Vibration","Metallic_glass","Mean_free_path","Splat_quenching","Metallic_bond","Electron_mobility","Electron","Chemical_bonds","Nearly_free_electron_model","Charge_distribution","Solid","Electrical_conductivity","Mean_free_path","Short-range_order","Order_and_disorder_(physics)","Polymorphism_(materials_science)","Chemical_bond","Anisotropy","Isotropic","Metallic","Anisotropic","Metallic","Covalent","Chemical_family","Periodic_table","Elemental","Solid"]}
