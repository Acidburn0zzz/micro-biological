He has\ncontributed to the understanding of how transfer RNA is generated,\nand the regulation of maturation of amphibian eggs. He has been a foreign\nassociate of the United States National Academy of Sciences since 2001.\n\nHe was born in Cartago, Costa Rica, son of Octavio Allende EcheverrÃ­a (Chilean)\nand Amparo Rivera Ortiz (Costa Rican) on November 11, 1934.\n\nBetween 1947 and 1949, he studied in the Liceo Aleman of Santiago. In 1949 he\nmoved to New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, where his father had been appointed\nChilean Consul. He studied and graduated from Jesuit High School and\nsubsequently studied in the Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, La. In\nthis University he obtained a degree of Bachelor of Sciences in Chemistry in\n1957. He carried out doctoral studies at Yale University in New Haven,\nConnecticut, USA, obtaining his Ph.D. in 1961 under the tutorship of Prof.\nF.M. Richards.\n\nOn September 16, 1961, he married Catherine Connelly in Holyoke, Massachusetts\nand with her, he raised a family of four children: Miguel Luis, Juan Ignacio,\nJorge Eduardo and Maria Amparo and 10 grand children.\n\nIn 1961 he entered as an academic in the Faculty of Medicine of the University\nof Chile, where he has stayed to the present time.\n\nHis scientific interests have evolved with time from the initial studies on\nmechanisms of protein biosynthesis, the genetic code, the effects of\nprogesterone on the meiotic maturation of oocytes, the metabolism of cAMP and in\nthe last decade on protein kinases, enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins.\n\nHis undergraduate teaching was concentrated n the chapters of Molecular Biology,\nGenetic Engineering, the Human Genome and the Oncogenes.\n\nAt the postgraduate level he has tutored 24 Doctoral thesis and several\nMaster's thesis. He has had post-docs from Italy, Belgium, USA, Argentina,\nCosta Rica and Chile.\n\nHe was the first director of the Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas (ICBM) of the\nFaculty of Medicine, University of Chile, between the years 1996-2002.\n\nHe has dedicated much effort in the organization of activities leading to the\nscientific integration of Latin America especially through the organization of a\nseries of Training Courses on Techniques of Molecular Biology in a 20 years\nperiod (1968â1988) and the generation of the Latin American Network of\nBiological Sciences (RELAB).\n\nHe has also been involved in the organization of a number of studies and events\nabout the development of science in Chile through his involvement in the Chilean\nAcademy of Sciences.\n\nIn recent years, he has contributed in the generation of the Project of\nInquiry Based Science Education in Chile which in the year 2006 benefited more\nthan 30.000 children in 94 schools in 6 cities of the country. He is\ncoordinator of the global program on science education of the Inter Academy\nPanel and at the hemispheric level by the Inter American Network of Academies\nof Sciences (IANAS).\n","linknr":106,"url":"Jorge_Allende","recorded":1376426145,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Jorge_Allende&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jorge_Allende&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Allende","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources","/wiki/Defamation","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jorge_Allende&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV","/wiki/Wikipedia:MOSBIO","/wiki/Professor","/wiki/University_of_Chile","/wiki/Transfer_RNA","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Amphibian","/wiki/Ovum","/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Jorge_Allende&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Jorge_Allende&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://books.google.com/books?id=lwtxcz9Zd6EC&pg=PA29&dq=%22Jorge+Allende%22+%22transfer+RNA%22&hl=en&ei=TlJYTZnpM42WsgOYoOiaDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Jorge%20Allende%22%20%22transfer%20RNA%22&f=false","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-3-527-30638-1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jorge_Allende&oldid=519251819","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","/wiki/Category:Biochemists","/wiki/Category:Chilean_scientists","/wiki/Category:Recipients_of_the_Great_Cross_of_the_National_Order_of_Scientific_Merit_(Brazil)","/wiki/Category:BLP_articles_lacking_sources_from_February_2011","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_a_promotional_tone_from_February_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_a_promotional_tone","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_February_2011","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jorge+Allende&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jorge+Allende","/wiki/Jorge_Allende","/wiki/Talk:Jorge_Allende","#","/wiki/Jorge_Allende","/w/index.php?title=Jorge_Allende&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jorge_Allende&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jorge_Allende&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Jorge_Allende","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Jorge_Allende","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Jorge_Allende&oldid=519251819","/w/index.php?title=Jorge_Allende&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6277634","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Jorge_Allende&id=519251819","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Jorge+Allende","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Jorge+Allende&oldid=519251819&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Jorge_Allende&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6277634#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:
