{"cursor":"2265","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Wright's stain' is a histologic stain that facilitates the differentiation of\nblood cell types. It is used primarily to stain peripheral blood smears and bone\nmarrow aspirates which are examined under a light microscope. In cytogenetics it\nis used to stain chromosomes to facilitate diagnosis of syndromes and diseases.\n\nIt is named for James Homer Wright, who devised the stain, a modification of the\nRomanowsky stain, in 1902. Because it distinguishes easily between blood cells,\nit became widely used for performing differential white blood cell counts, which\nare routinely ordered when infections are suspected.\n\nThere are related stains known as the 'buffered Wright stain', the 'Wright-\nGiemsa stain', and the 'buffered Wright-Giemsa stain', and specific instructions\ndepend on the solutions being used, which may include Eosin Y, Azure B, and\nMethylene Blue (some commercial preparations combine solutions to simplify\nstaining). The May-GrÃ¼nwald stain, which produces a more intense coloration,\nalso takes a longer time to perform.\n\nWhite blood cells stained with Wright's stain:\n\n{{multiple image \n| align =  direction = horizontal width = 200\n\n\n| image1 = Lymphocyte2.jpg width1 = alt1 = caption1 = lymphocyte\n\n\n| image2 = PBBasophil.jpg width2 = alt2 = caption2 = basophil\n\n\n| image3 = Eosinophil.jpg width3 = alt3 = caption3 = eosinophil\n\n\n| image4 = PBNeutrophil.jpg width4 = alt4 = caption4 = neutrophil\n\n\n\n\n| header = header_align =  header_background =\n| footer = footer_align =  footer_background =\n| background color =\n}}\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Wright's_stain","recorded":1376428374,"links":[],"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Staining"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["staining","biology"]],"members":["staining"],"related":["Histologic","Blood_cell","Peripheral_blood_smear","Bone_marrow","Needle_aspiration_biopsy","Light_microscope","Cytogenetics","James_Homer_Wright","Romanowsky_stain","White_blood_cell","Eosin_Y","Azure_B","Methylene_Blue","May-Grünwald_stain","Lymphocyte","Basophil","Eosinophil","Neutrophil","Diff-Quick","List_of_histologic_stains_that_aid_in_diagnosis_of_cutaneous_conditions","Romanowsky_stain","Staining_(biology)"]}
