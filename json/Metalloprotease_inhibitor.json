{"cursor":"1842","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Metalloprotease inhibitors' are cellular inhibitors of the matrix\nmetalloprotease (or metalloproteinase) family of proteins (MMP). Several other\nproteins have similar inhibitory effects, however none as effective (netrins,\nprocollagen C-terminal proteinase enhancer (PCPE), reversion-inducing cysteine-\nrich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI-\n2)). They might have other biological activities which haven't been fully\ncharacterised.\n\nThere are three classes of commonly used inhibitors for metalloproteinases.\n\n* In vitro, EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline and other chelating compounds lower the\n  concentration of metal to the point where the metal is removed from the enzyme\n  active site.\n\n* Classical lock and key inhibitors such as phosphoramidon and bestatin bind\n  tightly by approximating the transition state of the hydrolysis of the\n  peptide, preventing it from acting on other substrates.\n\n* Protein inhibitors such as Î±2-macroglobulin are known to work with\n  metalloproteinases.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Metalloprotease_inhibitor","recorded":1376427636,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protease inhibitors"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Enzyme_inhibitor","Metalloproteinase","Enzyme_inhibitor","Metalloproteinase","EDTA","1,10-phenanthroline","Chelating_agent","Enzyme","Active_site","Phosphoramidon","Bestatin","Transition_state","Macroglobulin"]}
