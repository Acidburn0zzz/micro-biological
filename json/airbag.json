It is an occupant restraint system\nconsisting of a flexible fabric envelope or cushion designed to inflate rapidly\nduring an automobile collision. Its purpose is to cushion occupants during a\ncrash and provide protection to their bodies when they strike interior objects\nsuch as the steering wheel or a window. Modern vehicles may contain multiple\nairbag modules in various side and frontal locations of the passenger seating\npositions, and sensors may deploy one or more airbags in an impact zone at\nvariable rates based on the type, angle and severity of impact; the airbag is\ndesigned to only inflate in moderate to severe frontal crashes. Airbags are\nnormally designed with the intention of supplementing the protection of an\noccupant who is correctly restrained with a seatbelt. Most designs are inflated\nthrough pyrotechnic means and can only be operated once. Newer side-impact\nairbag modules consist of compressed air cylinders that are triggered in the\nevent of a side impact vehicle impact.\n\nThe first commercial designs were introduced in passenger automobiles during the\n1970s with limited success. Broad commercial adoption of airbags occurred in\nmany markets during the late 1980s and early 1990s with a driver airbag, and a\nfront passenger airbag as well on some cars; and many modern vehicles now\ninclude four or more units.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"airbag","recorded":1376429107,"links":[],"instances":["automobile","europe"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1973 introductions","Aircraft emergency systems","American inventions","Automotive safety technologies","Bags"],"headings":["Terminology","History","How airbags work","Regulatory specifications","Maintenance","Injuries and fatalities","Aerospace and military applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["bumper","automobile"],["ford_escort","europe"]],"members":["bumper","ford_escort"],"related":["Automobile_safety","Collision","Vehicle","Seatbelt","Pyrotechnic","Seat_belt","Anti-lock_Braking_System","Advertising","Syntax","Ford_Motor_Company","Germans","Walter_Linderer","Compressed_air","Bumper_(automobile)","United_States_Navy","Patent","Japan_Automotive_Hall_of_Fame","Electromechanical","Magnet","Sodium_azide","Chrysler","Jan_24","Ford_Motor_Company","General_Motors","Oldsmobile_Toronado","Model_year","Lobbying","United_States","Seat_belt","Ford_Motor_Company","General_Motors","Automobile_safety","Mercedes-Benz","Mercedes-Benz_W126","Porsche","Porsche_944","Honda_Legend","Chrysler_S_platform","Jeep_Grand_Cherokee","Dodge_Intrepid","Eagle_Vision","Chrysler_Concorde","Dodge_Ram","Pickup_truck","Europe","Ford_Motor_Company","Ford_Escort_(Europe)","Vauxhall_Motors","Opel","Rover_Group","Peugeot","Renault","Fiat","Volkswagen_Golf_Mk4","Peugeot_306","Audi","Procon-ten","Ford_Fiesta","Peugeot_206","Toyota_Avensis","Russia","Lada","Citroën_C4","Chevrolet_Cobalt","Chevrolet_Silverado","Dodge_Ram","Autoliv","Volvo_850","Volkswagen_Polo_Mk5","BMW_E38","Toyota_Progrès","Volvo_S80","Sport_utility_vehicle","Multi-purpose_vehicle","Kia_Sportage","Toyota_Avensis","EuroNCAP","Glove_compartment","Toyota_iQ","Toyota_Crown_Majesta","Lexus_LFA","Ford_Explorer","Ford_Flex","Lincoln_MKT","Volvo_V40","Transport_Research_Laboratory","Honda","Motorcycle","Gold_Wing","Motorcycle_Grand_Prix","Dainese","Electronic_control_unit","Accelerometers","Wheel_speed_sensor","Gyroscope","Pressure_sensor","Gas_generator","Seat_belt","Pyrotechnic","Electric_match","Sodium_azide","Μm","Guanidine_nitrate","Nitroimidazole","Copper_nitrate","Side_curtain_airbag","Crash_test","Microelectromechanical_systems","Accelerometer","Integrated_circuit","Analog_Devices","Mercury_switch","Rolamite","Friction","Hysteresis","Sandia_National_Laboratories","Algorithms","Intellectual_property","Baby_seat","Gas_generator","Chemical_reaction","Nitrogen","Nitrogen","Argon","Propellant","Sodium_azide","Nitroguanidine","Ammonium_nitrate","Tetrazole","Triazole","Nitrate","Nitrite","Dicyanamide","Sodium_borohydride","Slag","Clay","Silica","Alumina","Nitrocellulose","Oxygen_balance","Carboxylic_acid","Chlorate","Perchlorate","Nitrogen_oxide","Cornstarch","French_chalk","Talcum_powder","Sodium_hydroxide","Sodium_bicarbonate","Potassium_chloride","Asthma","Total_loss","Seat_belt","National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration","Crash_test_dummy","ECE_regulations","United_Kingdom","Euro_NCAP","Automobile_safety","Germany","Auto_mechanic","Mercedes-Benz","Škoda_Auto","Volvo","AAA_World","TRW_Inc.","National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration","AAA_World","Head_injury","Landing","Aerospace","Federal_government_of_the_United_States","NASA","United_States_Department_of_Defense","Landing","Luna_9","Luna_13","Moon","Mars_Pathfinder","Aerobraking","Parachute","Solid_rocket","Mars_Exploration_Rover_Mission","Beagle_2","F-111_Aardvark","United_States_Army","UH-60_Black_Hawk","OH-58_Kiowa","Aviation_Applied_Technology_Directorate","Fort_Eustis","Virginia","BAE_Systems","Airbag_dermatitis","Airplane_airbags","Automobile_safety","Precrash_system","Safety_standards"]}
