Like the hypotrichs, with which they were originally classified,\nthey have body cilia fused into cirri, but these are mostly arranged into rows,\nrunning along the ventral surface or edges of the cell. Most stichotrichs are\nflattened and reasonably flexible. [[Stylonychia]] and [[Oxytricha]] are\nrepresentative genera. Some evidence suggests that the hypotrichs may be\nparaphyletic to them, and that they in turn may be paraphyletic to the\noligotrichs.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Stichotrich","recorded":1376429010,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ciliates","Spirotrichea","Sequenced genomes"],"headings":["Genomics","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Eukaryote","Alveolata","Ciliate","Spirotrich","Eugene_Small","Denis_Lynn","Ciliate","Protozoa","Spirotrich","Hypotrich","Cilia","Genus","Paraphyletic","Oligotrich"]}
