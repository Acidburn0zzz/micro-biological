Probes sent from Earth beginning in the late 20th century have\nyielded a dramatic increase in knowledge about the Martian system, focused\nprimarily on understanding its geology and possible habitability potential.\n\nEngineering interplanetary journeys is very complicated, so the exploration of\nMars has experienced a high failure rate, especially in earlier attempts.\nRoughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failed before completing\ntheir missions, and there are some that failed before their observations could\nbegin. However, missions have also met with unexpected levels of success, such\nas the twin Mars Exploration Rovers operating for years beyond their original\nmission specifications.\n\nSince 6 August 2012, there have been two scientific rovers on the surface of\nMars beaming signals back to Earth ([[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]], and\n[[Curiosity rover|Curiosity]] of the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] mission), and\nthree orbiters currently surveying the planet: [[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars\nOdyssey]], [[Mars Express]], and [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]].\n\nTo date, no sample return missions have been attempted for Mars, and one\nattempted return mission for Mars' moon Phobos ([[Fobos-Grunt]]) has failed.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Exploration_of_Mars","recorded":1376429122,"links":[],"instances":["spacecraft","moon","spacecraft","spacecraft","rover","planet","dwarf_planet","rocketry","crater","probe","astronomy","moon","crater"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Exploration
