{"cursor":"7806","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Ambrosia beetles' are beetles of the weevil subfamilies Scolytinae and\nPlatypodinae (Coleoptera, Curculionidae), which live in nutritional symbiosis\nwith ambrosia fungi and probably with bacteria. The beetles excavate tunnels\nin dead trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of\nnutrition. After landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a\ntunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus\npenetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the\nnutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery. The majority of\nambrosia beetles colonize xylem (sapwood and/or heartwood) of dying or\nrecently dead trees. Species differ in their preference for different parts of\ntrees, different stages of deterioration, in the shape of their tunnels\n(âgalleriesâ). However, the majority of ambrosia beetles are not specialized\nto any taxonomic group of hosts, unlike most phytophagous organisms including\nthe closely related bark beetles.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"ambrosia_beetle","recorded":1376418365,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Woodboring beetles","Curculionidae"],"headings":["Classification and diversity","The symbiotic relationship","Evolutionary origin","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Weevil","Scolytinae","Coleoptera","Curculionidae","Symbiosis","Ambrosia_fungi","Bacteria","Spore","Xylem","Phytophagous","Bark_beetle","Weevils","Convergent_evolution","Paleotropical","Xyleborini","Platypodinae","Neotropic","Platypodinae","Xyleborini","Cortylini","Nearctic","Xyloterini","Palearctic","Ecozone","Scolytoplatypodini","Larva","Mycelium","Sporodochia","Mycangium","Bionomy","Habitat","Asexual_reproduction","Phloem","Phytopathogen","Conifer","Mycangium","Laurel_wilt_disease","University_of_Florida","Institute_of_Food_and_Agricultural_Sciences"]}
