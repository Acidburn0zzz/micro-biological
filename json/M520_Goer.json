As\ntrucks go, the Caterpillar 'Goer' stands out, due to being articulated,\namphibious, overly wide and lacking suspension on the wheels.\n\nMid 1950s the US military were looking for a new, extreme off-road, tactical\ntruck series, with substantially increased load-carrying capacity. According to\na [http://forum.aceboard.net/12980-1229-25755-0-Caterpillar-M520-GOER-Amphibie-\nArticule.htm May 2006 article] in Classic Military Vehicle magazine, the United\nStates Armor Board began evaluating and testing commercially available, large,\nwheeled, articulated-steering, earth-moving equipment for potential tactical\napplication in 1956 / 1957. This resulted in development contracts for 4x4 all-\nterrain vehicles of various weight classes being awarded to Clark Equipment, Le\nTourneau-Westinghouse and Caterpillar Tractor Company.\n\nClark provided a 5-ton prototype, based on their Model 75 log-skidder, powered\nby a Cummins 6-cyl. Diesel engine. Caterpillar's entries were in the eight-ton\nclass and were designated: XM520 (8-ton cargo truck), XM553 (10-ton wrecker\nrecovering) and XM559 (8-ton, 2.500-gallon tanker) [http://www.panzerbaer.de/helper/us_trk_m520_goer-\na.htm]. Le Tourneau-Westinghouse offered three variants in the 15-ton class:\nXM437 Cargo, XM438 Tanker and XM554 Wrecker. Without exception, the\nprototypes consisted of two segments, housing engine and driver's compartment in\nthe front and using the rear part as main transport unit, whereby steering was\naccomplished by articulating the whole front unit relative to the rear, as\nopposed to pivot steering the front wheels conventionally. The large wheels with\nbig, low-pressure tyres were mounted without any suspension or steering\nmechanism, greatly simplifying the design. In order to keep the wheels on the\nground on uneven terrain, the front and rear units could not only swivel around\na vertical axis, but also along the vehicle's longitudinal axis, allowing\nsignificant articulation.\n\nThe Caterpillar design did well in testing, and in 1960 the company was awarded\na multi-million dollar contract for developing eight 8-ton cargo trucks,\ndelivered in 1961 and 1962, as well as two 10-ton wreckers and two 2500-gallon\ntankers in 1962. Another twenty-three units were ordered in 1963, and field-\ntested in Germany in 1964, and later in Vietnam in 1966. Not until 1971 did\nCaterpillar eventually receive a production contract for 1300 units: 812 M520\ncargo-vehicles, 371 M559 tankers and 117 M553 wreckers. Production began in 1972\nand lasted through June 1976. When fitted with its own crane, the cargo variant\nwould be designated M877.\n\nNot only did the Caterpillar offer extreme off-road ability, including 20Â°\nlongitudinal articulation and 30Â° side-slopes, it was also fully amphibious,\nusing the wheels for propulsion in the water. The rear cargo-bed tailgate and\ndrop-side doors, that allowed rapid discharge of cargo, had watertight seals to\npreserve the unit's swimming capability. In the USâs involvement in the Vietnam\nWar, the Goer developed a reputation of being able to go where other trucks\ncould not, and it was one of the preferred resupply vehicles after the pre-\nproduction units' introduction in 1966. They achieved a 90% availability rate\neven though spare parts for the Goer were not an official part of the US Army\ninventory until 1972.\n\nNevertheless the vehicle's lack of suspension made it too bouncy on hardened\nsurfaces, making most drivers shy away from its 31 mph (50 km/h) top\nspeed. The method for keeping bounce to a minimum on hard roads was to gently\nsway the vehicle left and right at top speed. The bilge pumps were often abused\non hard road convoys as \"super-squirters\" by bored drivers as they would\naccumulate water in the hull and drivers soon realized havoc could be raised by\nturning on the high volume pumps to douse passing and oncoming traffic. The\noscillating cab was also dangerous as entering or exiting the vehicle with the\nengine off could put pressure on the steering wheel and when the engine was\nstarted the cab would turn without warning. Also its oversize dimensions proved\ngenerally awkward, so in the 1980s it was replaced by the Oshkosh Heavy Expanded\nMobility Tactical Truck series, that combined good on-road behavior with\nadequate off-road performance. As the Goers were surplused accordingly, it was\ndone so under a demilitarization order similar to that of the M151 MUTT jeep.\nCore components in the steering and driveline were destroyed before the remains\nof the vehicle were sold off. Consequently only very few vehicles remained in\nexistence, in museums and private collections.\n","linknr":119,"url":"M520_Goer","recorded":1376429312,"links":["/w/index.php?title=M520_Goer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=M520_Goer&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M520_Goer","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:M520.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/M520.jpg/280px-M520.jpg","/wiki/Heavy_Expanded_Mobility_Tactical_Truck","/wiki/Car_classification","/wiki/Automobile_layout","/wiki/Four-wheel_drive","/wiki/Automobile_platform","/wiki/Engine","/wiki/Transmission_(mechanics)","/wiki/Wheelbase","/wiki/Curb_weight","/wiki/US_Army","/wiki/Heavy_Expanded_Mobility_Tactical_Truck","/wiki/Articulated_vehicle","/wiki/Amphibious_vehicle","http://forum.aceboard.net/12980-1229-25755-0-Caterpillar-M520-GOER-Amphibie-Articule.htm","/wiki/4x4","/wiki/Clark_Equipment_Company","/wiki/Caterpillar,_Inc.","/wiki/Cummins","http://www.panzerbaer.de/helper/us_trk_m520_goer-a.htm","/wiki/Articulated_vehicle","/wiki/File:M520_afloat.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/M520_afloat.jpg/300px-M520_afloat.jpg","/wiki/File:M520_afloat.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/HEMTT","/wiki/M151_MUTT","/w/index.php?title=M520_Goer&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=M520_Goer&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/G-numbers","/wiki/M-numbers","/w/index.php?title=M520_Goer&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=M520_Goer&veaction=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=M520_Goer&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=M520_Goer&veaction=edit&section=3","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:M520_Goer","http://www.olive-drab.com/idphoto/id_photos_m520.php3?PHPSESSID=565b2978ff32b763b09ee5e96b3b91e9/The","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=M520_Goer&oldid=562738974","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Wheeled_amphibious_vehicles","/wiki/Category:Articulated_vehicles","/wiki/Category:Military_trucks_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Off-road_vehicles","/wiki/Category:Caterpillar_Inc._vehicles","/wiki/Category:Military_vehicles_1970%E2%80%931979","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=M520+Goer&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=M520+Goer","/wiki/M520_Goer","/wiki/Talk:M520_Goer","#","/wiki/M520_Goer","/w/index.php?title=M520_Goer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=M520_Goer&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=M520_Goer&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/M520_Goer","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/M520_Goer","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=M520_Goer&oldid=562738974","/w/index.php?title=M520_Goer&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1090937","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=M520_Goer&id=562738974","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=M520+Goer","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=M520+Goer&oldid=562738974&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=M520_Goer&printable=yes","//fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%B5%DB%B2%DB%B0_%DA%AF%D9%88%D8%B1","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/M520_GOER","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/M520_Goer","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1090937#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License",
