{"cursor":"11864","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Lugol's iodine', also known as 'Lugol's solution', first made in 1829, is a\nsolution of elemental iodine and potassium iodide in water, named after the\nFrench physician J.G.A. Lugol. Lugol's iodine solution is often used as an\nantiseptic and disinfectant, for emergency disinfection of drinking water, and\nas a reagent for starch detection in routine laboratory and medical tests. These\nuses are possible since the solution is a source of effectively free elemental\niodine, which is readily generated from the equilibration between elemental\niodine molecules and triiodide ion in the solution.\n\nIt has been used more rarely to replenish iodine\ndeficiency. http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/iodine/ Higdon,\nJ., \"Micronutrient Information Center: Iodine,\" Linus Pauling Institute/Oregon\nState University; April, 2003 (revised by Drake, V.J., July, 2007). However, pure\npotassium iodide, containing the relatively benign iodide ion without the more\ntoxic elemental iodine, is strongly preferred for this purpose. Likewise, in the\nChernobyl disaster some Lugol's solution was used as an emergency source of\niodide to block radioactive iodine uptake, simply because it was widely\navailable as a drinking water decontaminant, and pure potassium iodide without\niodine (the preferred agent) was not available.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Lugol's_iodine","recorded":1376428361,"links":[],"instances":["biology","molecule","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Antiseptics","Disinfectants","Staining dyes","Iodine","Chemical tests"],"headings":["Formula and manufacture","Applications","Historical applications","Toxicity","References","See also"],"image":[],"tags":[["mass_concentration","chemistry"],["mass_concentration","chemistry"],["water","molecule"],["staining","biology"]],"members":["staining","water","mass_concentration"],"related":["Iodine","Potassium_iodide","France","Jean_Guillaume_Auguste_Lugol","Antiseptic","Disinfectant","Iodine_test","Triiodide","Iodide_deficiency","Potassium_iodide","Iodide","Ion","Iodine","Chernobyl_disaster","Iodine","Mass_concentration_(chemistry)","Iodine","Mass_concentration_(chemistry)","Potassium_iodide","Water_(molecule)","Soluble","Triiodide","Tincture_of_iodine","Mordant","Gram_Stain","Crystal_violet","Starch","Organic_compounds","Polysaccharide","Glucose","Fructose","Amyloidosis","Staining_(biology)","Cell_nucleus","Colposcopy","Vagina","Cervix","Biopsy","Schiller's_Test","Mucogingival_junction","Gingiva","Gingiva","Cell_membrane","Osmosis","Germicide","Coral","Polyp","Thyroidectomy","Grave's_disease","Euthyroid","Antithyroid_agent","Levothyroxine","Gout","Hyperthyroidism","Wolff-Chaikoff_effect","Organification","Hypothyroidism","Chernobyl_disaster","Potassium_iodide","SSKI","Thyroid_cancer","Alternative_medicine","United_States_of_America","Over-the-counter_drug","Reagent","Antiseptic","Preservative","Drug_Enforcement_Administration","DEA_list_of_chemicals","Clandestine_laboratory","Methamphetamine","Canada","Mexico","Betadine","Melzer's_reagent","Tincture_of_iodine","Benedict's_reagent"]}
