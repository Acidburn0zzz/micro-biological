During his reign, Justinian\nsought to revive the Empire's greatness and reconquer the lost western half of\nthe historical Roman Empire.\n\nOne of the most important figures of Late Antiquity and the last Roman Emperor\nto speak Latin as a first language, The Inheritance of Rome, Chris Wickham,\nPenguin Books Ltd. 2009, ISBN 978-0-670-02098-0 (page 90) Justinian's rule\nconstitutes a distinct epoch in the history of the Eastern Roman Empire. The\nimpact of his administration extended far beyond the boundaries of his time and\ndomain. Justinian's reign is marked by the ambitious but only partly realized\nrenovatio imperii, or \"restoration of the Empire\". J.F. Haldon, Byzantium in\nthe seventh century (Cambridge, 2003), 17â19.\n\nBecause of his restoration activities, Justinian has sometimes been called the\n\"Last Roman\" in modern historiography. For instance by G.P. Baker\n(Justinian, New York 1938), or in the Outline of Great Books series (Justinian\nthe Great). This ambition was expressed by the partial recovery of the\nterritories of the defunct Western Roman Empire. His general Belisarius swiftly\nconquered the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa, extending Roman control to the\nAtlantic Ocean. Subsequently Belisarius, Narses, and other generals conquered\nthe Ostrogothic Kingdom, restoring Dalmatia, Sicily, Italy, and Rome to the\nEmpire after more than half a century of barbarian control.\n\nThe prefect Liberius reclaimed most of southern Iberia, establishing the\nprovince of Spania. These campaigns re-established Roman control over the\nwestern Mediterranean, increasing the Empire's annual revenue by over a million\nsolidi. During his reign Justinian also subdued the [[Zan\npeople|Tzani]], a people on the east coast of the Black Sea that had never been\nunder Roman rule before. Evans, J. A. S., The Age of Justinian: the\ncircumstances of imperial power. p 93-94\n\nA still more resonant aspect of his legacy was the uniform rewriting of Roman\nlaw, the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]], which is still the basis of civil law in many\nmodern states. This work was carried out primarily by his quaestor Tribonian.\nHis reign also marked a blossoming of Byzantine culture, and his building\nprogram yielded such masterpieces as the church of Hagia Sophia, which was to be\nthe center of Eastern Orthodox Christianity for many centuries.\n\nA devastating outbreak of bubonic plague (see Plague of Justinian) in the early\n540s marked the end of an age of splendour. The Empire entered a period of\nterritorial decline not to be reversed until the 9th century.\n\nProcopius provides the primary source for the history of Justinian's reign. The\nSyriac chronicle of John of Ephesus, which does not survive, was used as a\nsource for later chronicles, contributing many additional details of value. Both\nhistorians became very bitter towards Justinian and his empress,\nTheodora. While he glorified Justinian's achievements in his panegyric and\nhis Wars, Procopius also wrote a hostile account, ''Anekdota'' (the so-called\nSecret History), in which Justinian is depicted as a cruel, venal, and\nincompetent ruler. Other sources include the histories of Agathias,\nMenander Protector, John Malalas, the Paschal Chronicle, the chronicles of\nMarcellinus Comes and Victor of Tunnuna.\n\nJustinian is considered a saint amongst Orthodox Christians, and is also\nremembered by some in the Lutheran Church on November 14. In the Eastern\nOrthodox Church, including the Orthodox Church in America, Justinian and his\nempress Theodora are commemorated on the anniversary of his death, 14\nNovember. Some denominations translate the Julian calendar date to 27 November\non the Gregorian calendar. The Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church -\nMissouri Synod and the Lutheran Church - Canada also remember Justinian on\nNovember 14.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Justinian_I","recorded":1376429121,"links":[],"instances":["lutheran","general","consul_500","magazine","gens","province","6th_century","class","title","catholic_church","ancient_historian","emperor","532","historian","legal_system","historian","praetorian_prefect","europe","emperor","religion","mesopotamia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["483
