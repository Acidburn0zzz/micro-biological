The\ninflammation may be caused by infection with viruses, bacteria, or other\nmicroorganisms, and less commonly by certain drugs.\nMeningitis can be life-threatening because of the inflammation's proximity to\nthe brain and spinal cord; therefore, the condition is classified as a medical\nemergency.\n\nThe most common symptoms of meningitis are headache and neck stiffness\nassociated with fever, confusion or altered consciousness, vomiting, and an\ninability to tolerate light (photophobia) or loud noises (phonophobia). Children\noften exhibit only nonspecific symptoms, such as irritability and drowsiness. If\na rash is present, it may indicate a particular cause of meningitis; for\ninstance, meningitis caused by meningococcal bacteria may be accompanied by a\ncharacteristic rash.\n\nA lumbar puncture diagnoses or excludes meningitis. A needle is inserted into\nthe spinal canal to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), that envelops\nthe brain and spinal cord. The CSF is examined in a medical laboratory. The first treatment in acute meningitis consists of promptly\nadministered antibiotics and sometimes antiviral drugs. Corticosteroids can also\nbe used to prevent complications from excessive inflammation. Meningitis can lead to serious long-term\nconsequences such as deafness, epilepsy, hydrocephalus and cognitive deficits,\nespecially if not treated quickly. Some forms\nof meningitis (such as those associated with meningococci, ''Haemophilus\ninfluenzae'' type B, pneumococci or mumps virus infections) may be prevented by\nimmunization.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Meningitis","recorded":1376429002,"links":[],"instances":["epidemiology","circulatory","medical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Disorders causing seizures","Medical
