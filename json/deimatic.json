In the cephalopods, different species of octopuses, squids, cuttlefish\nand the paper nautilus are deimatic. Vertebrates including several species of\nfrog put on warning displays; some of these species have poison glands. Among\nthe mammals, deimatic displays are found in species with strong defences, such\nas skunks and porcupines. Such displays are often combined with warning\ncoloration. Displays are classified as deimatic or aposematic by the responses\nof the animals that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn\nto eat the displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and the prey is\nbluffing; where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it, the display is\ntaken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"deimatic","recorded":1376428610,"links":[],"instances":["biology","mimicry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ethology","Warning coloration","Antipredator adaptations"],"headings":["In insects","In arachnids","In cephalopods","In vertebrates","Deimatic or aposematic?","See also","Bibliography","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["eyespot","mimicry"],["cheating","biology"]],"members":["cheating","eyespot"],"related":["Eyespot_(mimicry)","Moth","Butterflies","Mantidae","Phasmidae","Octopus","Squid","Cuttlefish","Paper_nautilus","Venom","Antipredator_adaptation","Skunk","Porcupine","Warning_coloration","Aposematic","Mantidae","Phasmatodea","Camouflage","Stridulation","Aposematic","Monoterpene","Moth","Owl","Peacock_butterfly","Noctuidae","Moth","Phasmatodea","Mantis","George_Robert_Gray","Hedgehog","Pompilidae","Mygalomorphae","Tarantula","Pedipalp","Scorpion","Cephalopoda","Namaqua_Chameleon","Madagascar","Aposematic","Rattlesnake","Aposematic","Arctiidae","Signalling_theory","Animal_coloration","Cheating_(biology)","Deception_in_animals","Signalling_theory"]}
