{"cursor":"4801","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Delayed open access journals' are traditional subscription-based journals that\nprovide open access or free access upon the elapse of an embargo period\nfollowing the initial publication date (with the embargo length varying from a\nfew months to two or more years). A journal subscription or an individual\narticle purchase fee would be required to access the materials before this\nembargo period ends. Some delayed open access journals also deposit their\npublications in open repositories when the author is bound by an (immediate or\ndelayed) open access mandate.\n\nMany scholarly society journals have adopted the delayed access model. While\nthis increases access to scholarly research literature for many, libraries that\ndo continue subscriptions under this model end up paying for access to a\n\"rolling file\" of the most recent material during its embargo period. The wide\nrange in embargo lengths â and the fact that open access is both defined and\nintended as the state of immediate access â limits the meaningfulness of\nclassifying journals as \"delayed open access\" journals. For example, Molecular\nBiology of the Cell has a one-month embargo, [http://www.molbiolcell.org/\nMolecular Biology of the Cell ] whereas Journal\nof the Physical Society of Japan [http://www.journalarchive.jst.go.jp/engli-\nsh/jnltop_en.php?cdjournal=jpsj1946 Publications - Top ] has a 15-year embargo period. While paper and microform formats of\nthese journals may be published too, the open access applies only to their\nelectronic versions. Hence such journals are not included in the lists of fully\nopen access journals, such as the Directory of Open Access Journals\n(DOAJ). [http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=loadTempl&templ=about DOAJ -\nDirectory of Open Access Journals ] In some\ncases, the free access to back issues of the journal is provided as a courtesy\nby the publisher; in other cases it follows from a legal agreement between the\npublishers and the authors, or their institutions, as in the above-mentioned\ncase of a delayed open access mandate.\n\nThe rationale for the access delay is to provide eventual access to the general\npublic while still providing incentive to researchers â and especially research\nlibraries â to sustain the subscriptions that cover the costs of publication.\nThe marginal costs of distributing an electronic journal to additional users are\ntrivial in comparison to distributing printed copies of the publication. Delayed\naccess publishers will spend little or no additional funds while marketing their\npublications to a broader population than those with personal subscriptions or\nthose affiliated with institutions that have institutional subscriptions or\nother forms of institutional access. The rationale assumes that researchers will\nwant the most recent papers in their subject immediately on publication, so\ntheir institutions will pay the necessary subscription or article purchase fees\nto access those articles. The rationale further assumes that students and others\naffiliated with smaller non-research institutions do not generally need to see\nthe article as quickly as researchers, as they are likely to be using it for a\nterm paper or similar project, rather than for original research. If libraries\nserving smaller colleges cannot afford subscriptions to the journal, researchers\nat such institutions are expected to use interlibrary loan services or direct\npurchases to access articles needed for their research.\n\nWhile the delayed open access model does increase access to scholarly research\nliterature for many users, it still requires libraries and scholars to continue\nsubscribing for immediate access to the most recent material during the embargo\nperiod. Although it may seem ironic that in the online era immediate access to\nresearch continues to be denied to those who need it most (researchers) if their\ninstitutions cannot afford to pay for it, researchers do have the option of\nproviding open access to their own published research immediately, by self-\narchiving it in their institutional repositories, as a\n[http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup/ growing number] of research\ninstitutions and research funders are now beginning to require researchers to do\nvia an open access mandate.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Delayed_open_access","recorded":1376424077,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Delayed_open_access_journal&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Delayed_open_access_journal&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_open_access_journal","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Delayed_open_access&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Scientific_journal","/wiki/Open_access","/wiki/Embargo_(academic_publishing)","/wiki/Institutional_repository","/wiki/Open_access_mandate","/wiki/Molecular_Biology_of_the_Cell","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Journal_of_the_Physical_Society_of_Japan","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Electronic_journal","/wiki/Directory_of_Open_Access_Journals","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Research_library","/wiki/Self-archiving","http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup/","/w/index.php?title=Delayed_open_access_journal&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Delayed_open_access_journal&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_open-access_journals","/wiki/Hybrid_open-access_journal","/wiki/Open_access_journal","/wiki/Self-archiving","/w/index.php?title=Delayed_open_access_journal&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Delayed_open_access_journal&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.molbiolcell.org/","#cite_ref-2","http://www.journalarchive.jst.go.jp/english/jnltop_en.php?cdjournal=jpsj1946","#cite_ref-3","http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=loadTempl&templ=about","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Delayed_open_access_journal&oldid=564701853","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Open_access_journals","/wiki/Category:Publishing_terms","/wiki/Category:Delayed_open_access_journals","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_May_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Delayed+open+access+journal&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Delayed+open+access+journal","/wiki/Delayed_open_access_journal","/wiki/Talk:Delayed_open_access_journal","#","/wiki/Delayed_open_access_journal","/w/index.php?title=Delayed_open_access_journal&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Delayed_open_access_journal&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Delayed_open_access_journal&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Delayed_open_access_journal","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Delayed_open_access_journal","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Delayed_open_access_journal&oldid=564701853","/w/index.php?title=Delayed_open_access_journal&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5253501","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Delayed_open_access_journal&id=564701853","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Delayed+open+access+journal","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Delayed+open+access+journal&oldid=564701853&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Delayed_open_access_journal&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5253501#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_open_access_journal","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.w
