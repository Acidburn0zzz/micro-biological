A week later, he took\nthe Preakness. That year, the Belmont (at the time the least of the three\nraces), had upped its purse to $50,000. Pensive was in the lead when Bounding\nHome inched by to take the race by less than half a length.\n\nPensive was brought to the United States still forming in his mother's womb by\nArthur B. Hancock, who then sold the mare to the owner of Calumet Farm, Warren\nWright. Wright had inherited Calumet from his father, William Monroe Wright,\npresident of the Calumet Baking Powder Company. In time, Warren Wright was also\npresident of the baking powder company, and he took it to the financial heights\nof the business world. When he also took over Calumet in 1931, he sold off the\ntrotters his father favored and began buying Thoroughbreds for flat racing.\nUnder Wright, Calumet enjoyed years of racing dominance.\n\nPensive began his training under Calumet's future Hall of Fame trainer\nBen A. Jones.\n\nAt two, Pensive raced five times, winning twice. His three losses all came in\nstakes races. At three, he ran a checkered season, winning and losing fairly\nequally. He beat older horses in the Rowe Memorial Handicap, but lost to an\nolder horse, Tola Rose, in the Bowie Handicap. Tola Rose had defeated Whirlaway.\n\nFollowing his loss in the Belmont, Pensive lost all eight of his final starts.\n\nAt this point he was retired to stud, producing the winner of the 1949 Kentucky\nDerby, Ponder. He died in 1949, just after his son won the Derby. Pensive is\nburied at Calumet Farm.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Pensive","recorded":1376418414,"links":[],"instances":["horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","united_states","coat"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1941 racehorse births","1949 racehorse deaths","Thoroughbred racehorses","Racehorses bred in Kentucky","Racehorses trained in the United States","American racehorses","Kentucky Derby winners","Preakness Stakes winners"],"headings":["Breeding","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["hyperion","horse"],["gainsborough","horse"],["stallion","horse"],["chestnut","color"],["champagne_stakes","united_states"],["chestnut","coat"],["hyperion","horse"],["ponder","horse"],["hyperion","horse"],["gainsborough","horse"],["bayardo","horse"],["st._simon","horse"],["minoru","horse"]],"members":["bayardo","minoru","hyperion","stallion","ponder","gainsborough","champagne_stakes","chestnut"],"related":["Hyperion_(horse)","Gainsborough_(horse)","Stallion_(horse)","United_States","Chestnut_(color)","Calumet_Farm","Calumet_Farm","Ben_A._Jones","Champagne_Stakes_(United_States)","Chestnut_(coat)","Thoroughbred","Racehorse","United_Kingdom","Hyperion_(horse)","Conn_McCreary","Kentucky_Derby","Preakness_Stakes","Bounding_Home","Arthur_B._Hancock","Calumet_Farm","Warren_Wright","William_Monroe_Wright","Calumet_Baking_Powder_Company","Harness_racing","Flat_racing","National_Museum_of_Racing_and_Hall_of_Fame","Ben_A._Jones","Whirlaway","Ponder_(horse)","Hyperion_(horse)","Gainsborough_(horse)","Bayardo_(horse)","Sunstar","Bay_Ronald","St._Frusquin","St._Simon_(horse)","Minoru_(horse)"]}
