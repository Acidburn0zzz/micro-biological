The\nshow features Sheindlin adjudicating real-life small claims disputes within a\nsimulated courtroom set. All parties involved must sign contracts,\nagreeing to arbitration under Sheindlin. The series is in first-run syndication\nand distributed by CBS Television Distribution.\n\nJudge Judy, which premiered on September 16, 1996, reportedly revitalized the\ncourt show genre. http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu-\n/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1566&context=fac_pubs Only two other arbitration-\nbased reality court shows preceded it, [[The People's Court]] (its first life\ncancelled in 1993 from low ratings) and [[Court show#List of originally\nnontraditional court shows|Jones and Jury]] (lasting only the 1994â95 season,\nshort-lived from low ratings). Sheindlin has been\ncredited with introducing the \"tough\" adjudicating approach into the judicial\ngenre, which has led to several imitators. The two court\nshows that outnumber Judge Judys seasons, The People's Court and [[Divorce\nCourt]], have both lasted via multiple lives of production and shifting\narbiters, making Sheindlin's span as a television arbiter the\nlongest.\n\nBy 2011, Judge Judy had been nominated 14 consecutive years for Daytime Emmy\nAwards without ever winning. On June 14, 2013, however,\nJudge Judy won its first Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program on\nits 15th nomination. It is the first long-running, highly-rated court\nshow to win an Emmy.\n\nSince its premiere, Judge Judy has been the ratings leader in courtroom\nprogramming.  As early as its\n3rd season (1998â99), Judge Judy was the highest-rated program in daytime\ntelevision, this lasting three consecutive years through its 5th season\n(2000â01). The show recaptured this title by its 14th season (2009â10) and has\nbeen the highest rated program in daytime ever since. During the 2011-12 term, Judy was not only\nnamed highest-rated program in daytime, but highest-rated program in all of\nsyndication, averaging a 7.0 rating. r-\nating.http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/489141-\nSyndication_Ratings_Judge_Judy_Is_Queen_of_Syndie_Season.php The show has\nbeen renewed several times, the most recent on April 4, 2013, with Sheindlin\nextending her contract through 2016â17, which will be the show's 21st season.
