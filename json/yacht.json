The term originated from the Dutch\nJacht meaning \"hunt\". Same Proto-Germanic root as German\nJÃ¤ger, as in JÃ¤germeister It was originally defined as a light fast\nsailing vessel used by the Dutch navy to pursue pirates and other\ntransgressors around and into the shallow waters of the Low Countries. After\nits selection by Charles II of England as the vessel to carry him to Britain\nfrom Holland for his restoration, it came to be used to mean a vessel used to\nconvey important persons.\n\nIn modern use the term designates two rather different classes of watercraft,\nsailing and power boats. Yachts are different from working ships mainly by their\nleisure purpose, and it was not until the rise of the steamboat and other types\nof powerboat that sailing vessels in general came to be perceived as luxury, or\nrecreational vessels. Later the term came to encompass motor boats for primarily\nprivate pleasure purposes as well.\n\nYacht lengths generally range from up to dozens of metres (hundreds of feet). A\nluxury craft smaller than is more commonly called a cabin cruiser or simply a\ncruiser. A super yacht generally refers to any yacht (sail or power) above and a\nmega yacht generally refers to any yacht over . This size is small in relation\nto typical cruise liners and oil tankers.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"yacht","recorded":1376429358,"links":[],"instances":["boat","unit","watercraft","wood","sail"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Yachts","Dutch inventions"],"headings":["History","Yacht ensign","Construction materials and techniques","Sailing yachts","Motor yachts","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["veneer","wood"],["genoa","sail"],["genoa","sail"],["head","watercraft"],["knot","unit"],["cutter","boat"]],"members":["cutter","knot","head","veneer","genoa"],"related":["Brittany","France","Marina","Rostock","Germany","Boat","Ship","Dutch_language","Jägermeister","Charles_II_of_England","Watercraft","Steamboat","Motor_boat","Cabin_cruiser","Luxury_yacht","Luxury_yacht","Cruise_ship","Oil_tanker","Dutch_East_India_Company","Leeboard","Dutch_language","Low_German","Standard_German","High_German","Sailing","Sailboat","Royal_Netherlands_Navy","Piracy","Low_Countries","Customs","Maritime_pilot","Ship_of_the_line","Gaff_rig","Charles_II_of_England","Commonwealth_of_England","Netherlands","Cox_&_King_yachts","Civil_ensign","Fouled_anchor","Ensign_of_the_United_States","Cargo","Customs","Smuggling","Fibreglass","Aluminium","Steel","Carbon_fibre","Ferrocement","Plywood","Veneer_(wood)","Balsa","Epoxy","Length_Over_All","Sailboats","Yachting","Sail-plan","Bermuda_rig","Dinghy","Centreboard","Daggerboard","Keel","Trailer_sailer","Foresail","Jib","Genoa_(sail)","Mainsail","Gaff_rig","Jib","Genoa_(sail)","Mainsail","Spinnaker","Head_(watercraft)","Knot_(unit)","Mass_production","Europe","North_America","Marina","Cutter_(boat)","Yawl","Ketch","Schooner","Junk_rig","Keel","Tide","Fiberglass","Air_conditioning","Electricity_generation","Electric_lighting","Radio","Navigation","Global_Positioning_System","Radar","Echo-sounding","Autopilot","Alternator","Rechargeable_battery","International_One_Design","Bermuda_Race","Global_Challenge","Volvo_Ocean_Race","Clipper_Round_the_World_Race","Mini_Transat_6.50","Monohull","Multihull","Catamaran","Trimaran","Poland","Boston_Harbor","Cruiser_yacht","Sport_fishing","Luxury_yacht","Internal_combustion_engine","Diesel_fuel","Gasoline","International_Sailing_Federation","List_of_large_sailing_yachts","List_of_motor_yachts_by_length","List_of_sailboat_designers_and_manufacturers","Luxury_yacht","Luxury_yacht_tender","Model_yachting","Sailing_yacht","Yacht_broker","Yacht_charter","Yacht_Transport","Yachting"]}
