It is listed\nas Least Concern by the IUCN on account of its widespread range and large\nnumbers estimated between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals. The\nspecies is however experiencing declines outside of protected areas due to\nhabitat loss and poaching. The species may have originated in\nAsia, and once ranged throughout Europe for at least one\nmillion years until the end of the Late Pleistocene. The\nspotted hyena is the largest member of the Hyaenidae, and is further physically\ndistinguished from other species by its vaguely bear-like build, its rounded ears, its less prominent mane,\nits spotted pelt, its more dual purposed dentition, its fewer nipples and the presence of a pseudo-\npenis in the female. It is the only mammalian species to lack an external\nvaginal opening.\n\nThe spotted hyena is the most social of the Carnivora in that it has the largest\ngroup sizes and most complex social behaviours. Its social\norganisation is unlike that of any other Carnivore, bearing closer resemblance\nto that of cercopithecine primates (baboons and macaques) with respect to group-\nsize, hierarchical structure, and frequency of social interaction among both kin\nand unrelated group-mates. However, the social system of\nthe spotted hyena is openly competitive rather than cooperative, with access to\nkills, mating opportunities and the time of dispersal for males depending on the\nability to dominate other clan-members. Females provide only for their own cubs\nrather than assist each other, and males display no paternal care. Spotted hyena\nsociety is matriarchal; females are larger than males, and dominate them.\n\nThe spotted hyena is a highly successful animal, being the most common large\ncarnivore in Africa. Its success is due in part to its adaptability and\nopportunism; it is primarily a hunter but may also scavenge, with the capacity\nto eat and digest skin, bone and other animal waste. In functional terms, the\nspotted hyena makes the most efficient use of animal matter of all African\ncarnivores. The spotted hyena displays greater\nplasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other African\ncarnivores; it hunts alone, in small parties of 2â5\nindividuals or in large groups. During a hunt, spotted hyenas often run through\nungulate herds in order to select an individual to attack. Once selected, their\nprey is chased over long distance, often several kilometres, at speeds of up to\n60 km/h.\n\nThe spotted hyena has a long history of interaction with humanity; depictions of\nthe species exist from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings\nfrom the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves. The species has a\nlargely negative reputation in both Western culture and African folklore. In the\nformer, the species is mostly regarded as ugly and cowardly, while in the\nlatter, it is viewed as greedy, gluttonous, stupid, and foolish, yet powerful\nand potentially dangerous. The majority of Western perceptions on the species\ncan be found in the writings of Aristotle and Pliny the Elder, though in\nrelatively unjudgemental form. Explicit, negative judgements occur in the\n[[Physiologus]], where the animal is depicted as a hermaphrodite and grave\nrobber. The IUCN's hyena specialist group identifies the\nspotted hyena's negative reputation as detrimental to the species' continued\nsurvival, both in captivity and the wild.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Spotted_hyena","recorded":1376428760,"links":[],"instances":["profession","animal_behavior","animal","zambia","ethiopia","sense","ethology","sudan_and_uganda","taxonomy","clothing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fauna
