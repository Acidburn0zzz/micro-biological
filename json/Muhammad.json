He is\nbelieved by Muslims and BahÃ¡'Ã­s to be a messenger and prophet of God. Muhammad\nis almost universally considered by Muslims as the last prophet sent by God for\nmankind. Not all Muslims believe Muhammad was the last\nprophet. For example, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community considers Mirza Ghulam\nAhmad to be a prophet as well. The Nation of Islam considers Elijah Muhammad to\nbe a prophet (source: African American Religious Leaders - Page 76, Jim Haskins,\nKathleen Benson - 2008). United Submitters International consider Rashad Khalifa\nto be a prophet. (source: Miniatures: Views of Islamic and Middle Eastern\nPolitics - Page 98, Daniel Pipes - 2004) ( Hadhrat Muhammad (PUBH) the Last\nProphet|publisher=Ahmadiyya Muslim Community}}) While non-Muslims regard\nMuhammad to have been the founder of Islam, Muslims consider him to\nhave been the restorer of an unaltered original monotheistic faith of Adam,\nNoah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets.

Three\n  years after this event Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly,\n  proclaiming that \"God is One\", that complete \"surrender\" to Him (lit.\n  [[Islam#Etymology and meaning|islÄm]]) is the only way ([[Deen (Arabic\n  term)|dÄ«n]]) 'Islam' is always referred to in the Quran as a\n  dÄ«n, a word that means \"way\" or \"path\" in Arabic, but is usually translated in\n  English as \"religion\" for the sake of convenience acceptable to God, and\n  that he himself was a prophet and messenger of God, in the same vein as other\n  Islamic prophets.

To escape\npersecution, Muhammad sent some of his followers to Abyssinia before he and his\nfollowers in Mecca migrated to Medina (then known as Yathrib) in the year 622.\nThis event, the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, which is\nalso known as the Hijri Calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under\nthe Constitution of Medina. After eight years of fighting with the Meccan\ntribes, his followers, who by then had grown to 10,000, took control of Mecca\nin the largely peaceful Conquest of Mecca. He destroyed the pagan idols in the\ncity Sahih-Bukhari, Book 43, #658 and then sent his followers out to\ndestroy all of the remaining pagan temples in Eastern Arabia.

Princeton University Press, pg. 21â22 In 632, a few\nmonths after returning to Medina from The Farewell Pilgrimage, Muhammad fell\nill and died. By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had\nconverted to Islam, and he had united Arabia into a single Muslim religious\npolity. \"Muhammad,\" Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world See:\n* Holt (1977a), p.57\n* Lapidus (2002), pp 0.31 and 32 \n\nThe revelations (or [[Ayah]], lit. \"Signs [of God]\") â which Muhammad\nreported receiving until his death â form the verses of the Quran, regarded by\nMuslims as the \"Word of God\" and around which the religion is based.
