{"cursor":"4151","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'James V. McConnell' (October 26, 1925 â€“ April 9, 1990) was an American\nbiologist and animal psychologist. He is most known for his research on learning\nand memory transfer in planarians conducted in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nMost of McConnell's academic career was spent in the psychology department at\nthe University of Michigan, where he was a professor from 1963 through his\nretirement in 1988. He was an unconventional scientist, setting up his own\nrefereed journal, the [[Journal of Biological Psychology]], which was published\nin tandem with the [[Worm Runner's Digest]], a planarian-themed humor magazine.\nHis paper Memory transfer through cannibalism in planarians, published in the\n[[Journal of Neuropsychiatry]], reported that when planarians conditioned to\nrespond to a stimulus were ground up and fed to other planarians, the recipients\nlearned to respond to the stimulus faster than a control group did. McConnell\nbelieved that this was evidence of a chemical basis for memory, which he\nidentified as memory RNA. Although well publicized, his findings were not\ncompletely reproducible by other scientists and were therefore at the time\ncompletely discredited (for review, see Chapouthier, 1973).\n\nHowever, recently, his research has begun to be seen in a new light in view of\nindependent research with RNA interference, with at least one scientist\nspeculating that McConnell may have been on the right track (Smallheiser, 2001).\n\nHe originally published satirical articles and serious scientific articles in\nthe Journal of Biological Psychology but received complaints that it was\ndifficult if not impossible to tell which was which. He decided to publish the\nsatirical [[Worm Runner's Digest]] upside down with its cover as the back of the\nJournal of Biological Psychology to make it clear which articles were satire.\nThis, he said, created problems with librarians returning the Journal to the\npublisher with the complaint that it was improperly bound. He was amused by\nthis. He spent many of his evening hours in the 1960s in informal rap sessions\nwith students in their dorms. He was prone to making provocative statements,\nbelieved that memory was chemically based and that in the future humanity would\nbe programmed by drugs. He once commented that he would rather be \"a programmer\nthan a programmee\".\n\nMcConnell was one of the targets of Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber. In 1985,\nhe suffered a hearing loss when a bomb, disguised as a manuscript, was opened at\nhis house by his research assistant Nicklaus Suino.\n","linknr":106,"url":"James_V._McConnell","recorded":1376425354,"links":["/w/index.php?title=James_V._McConnell&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=James_V._McConnell&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_V._McConnell","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Biologist","/wiki/Memory_transfer","/wiki/Planarian","/wiki/Psychology","/wiki/University_of_Michigan","/wiki/Professor","/wiki/Scientific_journal","/w/index.php?title=Journal_of_Biological_Psychology&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Worm_Runner%27s_Digest","/wiki/Magazine","/w/index.php?title=Journal_of_Neuropsychiatry&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Memory_RNA","/wiki/Worm_Runner%27s_Digest","/wiki/Theodore_Kaczynski","/wiki/Letter_bomb","/w/index.php?title=James_V._McConnell&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=James_V._McConnell&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Georges_Chapouthier","/w/index.php?title=James_V._McConnell&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=James_V._McConnell&veaction=edit&section=2","http://www.trivia-library.com/a/biography-of-famous-scientist-james-v-mcconnell-part-1.htm","http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1996/apr/04-04-96/news/unabomber.html","http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=826389","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/57898937","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_V._McConnell&oldid=543908766","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1925_births","/wiki/Category:1990_deaths","/wiki/Category:American_neuroscientists","/wiki/Category:American_biologists","/wiki/Category:Unabomber_targets","/wiki/Category:University_of_Michigan_faculty","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=James+V.+McConnell&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=James+V.+McConnell","/wiki/James_V._McConnell","/wiki/Talk:James_V._McConnell","#","/wiki/James_V._McConnell","/w/index.php?title=James_V._McConnell&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=James_V._McConnell&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=James_V._McConnell&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/James_V._McConnell","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/James_V._McConnell","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=James_V._McConnell&oldid=543908766","/w/index.php?title=James_V._McConnell&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5686920","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=James_V._McConnell&id=543908766","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=James+V.+McConnell","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=James+V.+McConnell&oldid=543908766&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=James_V._McConnell&printable=yes","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_V._McConnell","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5686920#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_V._McConnell","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bit
