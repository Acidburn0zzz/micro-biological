It is the world's most populous country, with a population\nof over 1.35 billion. The PRC is a single-party state governed by the\nCommunist Party, with its seat of government in the capital city of Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , five\nautonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin,\nShanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative\nregions (Hong Kong and Macau). The PRC also claims\nTaiwan â which is controlled by the Republic of China (ROC), a separate\npolitical entity â as its 23rd province, a claim controversial due to the\ncomplex political status of Taiwan and the unresolved Chinese Civil\nWar.\n\nCovering approximately 9.6 million square kilometres, China is the world's\nsecond-largest country by land area, and the third or fourth-largest by\ntotal area, depending on the definition of total area. China's landscape is vast\nand diverse, ranging from forest steppes and the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in\nthe arid north to subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya,\nKarakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from South and\nCentral Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the\nworld, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard.\nChina's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is long, and is bounded by the Bohai,\nYellow, East and South China Seas.\n\nThe ancient Chinese civilization â one of the world's earliest â flourished in\nthe fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia,\nChina's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, known as dynasties,\nbeginning with the semi-mythological Xia of the Yellow River basin (c. 2000\nBCE). Since 221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several states to form\na Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and been reformed numerous\ntimes. The Republic of China overthrew the last dynasty in 1911, and ruled the\nChinese mainland until 1949. After the defeat of the Empire of Japan in World\nWar II, the Communist Party defeated the nationalist Kuomintang in mainland\nChina and established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October\n1949, while the Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to its present capital\nof Taipei.\n\nSince the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China has become the world's\nfastest-growing major economy. As of 2013, it is the world's second-largest\neconomy by both nominal total GDP and purchasing power parity (PPP), and is also\nthe world's largest exporter and importer of goods. China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and\nhas the world's largest standing army, with the second-largest defense\nbudget. The PRC has been a United Nations member since\n1971, when it replaced the ROC as a permanent member of the U.N. Security\nCouncil. China is also a member of numerous formal and informal multilateral\norganizations, including the WTO, APEC, BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation\nOrganisation, the BCIM and the G-20. China has been characterized as a potential\nsuperpower by a number of academics, military\nanalysts, and public policy and economics\nanalysts.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Peopleâs_Republic_of_China","recorded":1376428474,"links":[],"instances":["china","china","island","wu_shulian","countries","politics","zhuang_religion","nominal_per_capita","philosopher","china","board_game","philosophy","political","finance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Article
