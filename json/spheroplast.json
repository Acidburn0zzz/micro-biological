The name stems from the fact that after a microbe's cell wall is\ndigested, membrane tension causes the cell to acquire a characteristic spherical\nshape. Spheroplasts are osmotically fragile, and will lyse if transferred to a\nhypotonic solution.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"spheroplast","recorded":1376428983,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bacteria"],"headings":["Uses and applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Cell_wall","Penicillin","Lysis","Merck_and_Co.","Antibiotic","Fosfomycin","Cephamycin","Thienamycin","Carbapenems","Gram-negative","Bacteria","Ion_channels","Patch_clamp","Neurons","Cytoplasm","Patch_clamp","Phenotype","Overexpress","Xenopus","Oocyte","Yeast","Cell_wall","Zymolyase","Lysis","Transfection","Polyethylene_glycol","Protoplast"]}
