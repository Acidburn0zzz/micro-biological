In other words, a structural motif does not have\nto be associated with a sequence motif. Also, the existence of a sequence motif\ndoes not necessarily imply a distinctive structure. In most DNA motifs, for\nexample, it is assumed that the DNA of that sequence does not deviate from the\nnormal \"double helical\" structure.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Structural_motif","recorded":1376428512,"links":[],"instances":["biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein structural motifs","Protein structure"],"headings":["Structural motifs in proteins","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":[],"tags":[["antiparallel","biochemistry"]],"members":["antiparallel"],"related":["Polymer","Molecule","Protein","Nucleic_acid","Supersecondary_structure","Primary_structure","Sequence_motif","DNA","Gene","DNA_sequence","Amino_acid","Beta_hairpin","Antiparallel_(biochemistry)","Omega_loop","Basic-helix-loop-helix","Alpha_helix","Zinc_finger","Ion","Helix-turn-helix","Motif_domain","Sequence_motif","Short_linear_motif","PROSITE","Structural_Classification_of_Proteins","CATH","Families_of_structurally_similar_proteins","PASS2","SMoS"]}
