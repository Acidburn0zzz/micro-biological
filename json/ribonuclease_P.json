RNase\nP is unique from other RNases in that it is a ribozyme â a ribonucleic acid that\nacts as a catalyst in the same way that a protein based enzyme would. Its\nfunction is to cleave off an extra, or precursor, sequence of RNA on tRNA\nmolecules. Further RNase P is one of two known\nmultiple turnover ribozymes in nature (the other being the ribosome), the\ndiscovery of which earned Sidney Altman and Thomas Cech the Nobel Prize in\nChemistry in 1989: in the 1970s, Altman discovered the existence of precursor\ntRNA with flanking sequences and was the first to characterize RNase P and its\nactivity in processing of the 5' leader sequence of precursor tRNA. Recent\nfindings also reveal that RNase P has a new function. It has been shown that human nuclear RNase P is\nrequired for the normal and efficient transcription of various small noncoding\nRNA genes, such as tRNA, 5S rRNA, SRP RNA and U6 snRNA genes, which are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, one of\nthree major nuclear RNA polymerases in human cells.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"ribonuclease_P","recorded":1376418393,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ribonucleases","Ribozymes","RNA splicing"],"headings":["In bacteria","In archaea","In eukaryotes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Secondary_structure","Sequence_conservation","Gene","Ribozyme","Bacteria","Secondary_structure","Sequence_conservation","Gene","Ribozyme","Bacteria","Secondary_structure","Sequence_conservation","Gene","Ribozyme","Archaea","Secondary_structure","Sequence_conservation","Gene","Ribozyme","Archaea","Ribonuclease","RNA","Ribozyme","Protein","TRNA","Ribosome","Sidney_Altman","Thomas_Cech","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Non-coding_RNA","5S_ribosomal_RNA","Signal_recognition_particle","U6_spliceosomal_RNA","RNA_polymerase_III","Bacteria","Ribonucleoprotein","Archaea","Ribonucleoprotein","X-ray","NMR","Eukaryotes","Yeast","RNase_MRP","Nucleolus","Cell_cycle","Protein","RNA","Spinach","Chloroplast"]}
