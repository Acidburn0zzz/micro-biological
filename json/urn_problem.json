{"cursor":"5094","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In probability and statistics, an 'urn problem' is an idealized mental exercise\nin which some objects of real interest (such as atoms, people, cars, etc.) are\nrepresented as colored balls in an urn or other container. One pretends to draw\n(remove) one or more balls from the urn; the goal is to determine the\nprobability of drawing one color or another, or some other properties. A key\nparameter is whether each ball is returned to the urn after each draw.\n\nAn 'urn model' is either a set of probabilities that describe events\nwithin an urn problem, or it is a probability distribution, or a family of\nsuch distributions, of random variables associated with urn\nproblems.
