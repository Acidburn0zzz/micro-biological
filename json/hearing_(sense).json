The inability to hear is\n called deafness.\n\nIn humans and other vertebrates, hearing is performed primarily by the auditory\nsystem: vibrations are detected by the ear and transduced into nerve impulses\nthat are perceived by the brain (primarily in the temporal lobe).

Both hearing and touch are types of mechanosensation.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"hearing_(sense)","recorded":1376418384,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hearing|","Sound","Audiology","Auditory system"],"headings":["Hearing mechanism","Hearing tests","Defense mechanism","Hearing loss","Hearing aids","Hearing underwater","Hearing in animals","Mathematics","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Sound","Vibration","Ear","Solid","Liquid","Gas","Sense","Deafness","Auditory_system","Ear","Brain","Temporal_lobe","Touch","Outer_ear","Middle_ear","Inner_ear","Eardrum","Amplitude","Ossicles","Cochlea","Basilar_membrane","Tonotopy","Hair_cells","Auditory_nerve","Brainstem","Audiometer","Auditory_brainstem_response","Otoacoustic_emissions","Tensor_tympani_muscle","Bone_conduction","Frequency","Audio_frequency","Ultrasound","Infrasound","Microbat","Animal_echolocation","Dog","Dog_whistle","Snake","Whale","Giraffe","Dolphin","Elephant","Fish","Carp","Herring","Dither","Fourier_transform","Audiogram","Audiometry","Auditory_brainstem_response","Auditory_illusion","Auditory_processing_disorder","Auditory_scene_analysis","Auditory_system","Bone_conduction","Hearing_impairment","Hearing_range","Listening","Neuronal_encoding_of_sound","Presbycusis","Tinnitus"]}
