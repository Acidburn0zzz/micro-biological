{"cursor":"4386","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{multiple issues|\n\n\n}} For many years, efforts have been made to develop methods that would enhance\nthe sensitivity and specificity of the Papanicolaou smear (also called Pap\nsmear). Emphasis has been placed on creating automated screening machines whose\nsuccess depends on a representative sampling of cells on standardized slides\ncontaining a monolayer of well-stained, well-preserved cells.\n\nFrom this research and development, liquid-based gynecologic specimen collection\nhas evolved. Its proponents argue that liquid-based preparations outperform\nconventional smears because of improved fixation, decreased obscuring factors,\nand standardization of cell transfer. Proponents point out that, in direct\nsmears, the cells are not transferred in a representative fashion and that up to\n90% of the material scraped from the cervix may be discarded with the sampling\ndevice. With liquid-based collection, the sampling will be representative and\noperator-dependent variation will not occur since processing is controlled by\nthe laboratory.\n\nSurePath (TriPath Imaging, Inc, Burlington, NC) and ThinPrep 2000 System (Cytyc\nCorp, Marlborough, MA) are two such systems currently approved by the US FDA for\ncervicovaginal testing. With both methods, the sample is collected in the\nconventional manner with one of the brush instruments but, instead of being\nspread onto a glass slide, it is transferred to a vial of fixative.\n\nIn the SurePath method, the sample is vortexed, strained, layered onto a density\ngradient, and centrifuged. Instruments required are a computer-controlled\nrobotic pipette and a centrifuge. The cells form a circle 12.5 mm in\ndiameter. The ThinPrep method requires an instrument and special polycarbonate\nfilters. After the instrument immerses the filter into the vial, the filter is\nrotated to homogenize the sample. Cells are collected on the surface of the\nfilter when a vacuum is applied. The filter is then pressed against a slide to\ntransfer the cells into a 20 mm diameter circle.\n\nBoth methods result in a well preserved approximate monolayer of cells, with a\nbackground devoid of blood and mucus. However, the current high cost of these\npatented, commercial systems required of cytotechnologists and pathologists in\norder to interpret the ThinPrep slides, which has led to the development and\nevaluation of alternative, less costly methods.\n\nOne such method referred to as SpinThin, developed by Khalbuss et al. (2000),\nuses a modified electric toothbrush to release the cells into suspension from\nthe collecting device. The cells are spun directly onto a 10 Ã 20 mm area\nof a glass slide using a Cytospin II cytocentrifuge with megafunnel. Results\ncorrelated very well with conventional smears and follow-up histology.\n\nAnother method described by Johnson, et al. (2000) places the cervical\ncollection device into 15 ml of CytoRich Red (TriPath Imaging, Inc), a\nproprietary formula of buffering agents, emulsifiers, formaldehyde and alcohol.\nAfter arrival in the laboratory, cell suspensions are vortexed, poured through\ntulle (bridal veil fabric) and centrifuged. Following centrifugation, the\nsupernatant is discarded and the sediment is vortexed. A drop of sediment is\nplaced into an 8 ml Hettich cytocentrifuge chamber prefilled with 2 ml of\nCytoRich Yellow (TriPath Imaging, Inc), a proprietary Saccomanno-like fixative\nthat prevents dehydration and collapse of 3-dimensional structures when slides\nare air-dried, and then spun onto adhesive-coated slides. Advantages include\nbatch processing and reusability of its funnel assembly, which decreases the\nbulk of disposable plastic that can significantly impact the environment as well\nas add to the cost of individual tests. A similar method has been described by\nDr.Nandini Manoli, et al. Preliminary evaluation showed the method to\nbe as efficacious and, in two instances, more specific than its conventional\nsmear counterpart.\n","linknr":96,"url":"liquid-based_cytology","recorded":1376427966,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Liquid-based_cytology&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Liquid-based_cytology&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-based_cytology","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liquid-based_cytology&action=edit","/wiki/Talk:Liquid-based_cytology","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liquid-based_cytology&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Help:Section","/wiki/MOS:HEAD","/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity","/wiki/Papanicolaou_smear","/wiki/US_FDA","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Liquid-based_cytology&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Liquid-based_cytology&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","https://www.morebooks.de/store/gb/book/manual-liquid-based-cytology-method-for-detection-of-cervical-cancer/isbn/978-3-659-16476-7","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-3-659-16476-7","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liquid-based_cytology&oldid=537938413","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Histopathology","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_December_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_sections_from_December_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_sections","/wiki/Category:Articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify_from_December_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Liquid-based+cytology&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Liquid-based+cytology","/wiki/Liquid-based_cytology","/wiki/Talk:Liquid-based_cytology","#","/wiki/Liquid-based_cytology","/w/index.php?title=Liquid-based_cytology&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Liquid-based_cytology&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Liquid-based_cytology&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Liquid-based_cytology","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Liquid-based_cytology","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Liquid-based_cytology&oldid=537938413","/w/index.php?title=Liquid-based_cytology&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Liquid-based_cytology&id=537938413","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Liquid-based+cytology","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Liquid-based+cytology&oldid=537938413&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Liquid-based_cytology&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-based_cytology","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images
