The\nbrain and spinal cord together make up the central nervous system (CNS). The\nspinal cord begins at the occipital bone and extends down to the space between\nthe first and second lumbar vertebrae; it does not extend the entire length of\nthe vertebral column. It is around in men and around long in women. Also, the\nspinal cord has a varying width, ranging from 1/2 inch thick in the\ncervical and lumbar regions to 1/4 inch thick in the thoracic area. The\nenclosing bony vertebral column protects the relatively shorter spinal cord. The\nspinal cord functions primarily in the transmission of neural signals between\nthe brain and the rest of the body but also contains neural circuits that can\nindependently control numerous reflexes and central pattern generators. The\nspinal cord has three major functions: as a conduit for motor information, which\ntravels down the spinal cord, as a conduit for sensory information in the\nreverse direction, and finally as a center for coordinating certain reflexes.\n{{cite book\n  | last = Maton first = Anthea authorlink = coauthors = Jean Hopkins, Charles\n  | William McLaughlin, Susan Johnson, Maryanna Quon Warner, David LaHart, Jill\n  | D.
