{"cursor":"96540","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n The 'Paleolithic' (US spelling; also spelled 'Palaeolithic')\n'Age', 'Era' or 'Period', is a prehistoric period of human history distinguished\nby the development of the most primitive stone tools discovered (Grahame Clark's\nModes I and II), and covers roughly 99% of human technological prehistory. It\nextends from the earliest known use of stone tools, probably by hominins such as\naustralopithecines, 2.6 million years ago, to the end of the Pleistocene around\n10,000 BP.

The date of the PaleolithicâMesolithic boundary may\nvary by locality as much as several thousand years.\n\nDuring the Paleolithic, humans grouped together in small societies such as\nbands, and subsisted by gathering plants and fishing, hunting or scavenging wild\nanimals. {{cite book | author=McClellan\n|url=http://books.google.com/?id=aJgp94zNwNQC&printsec=frontcover#PPA11 |\ntitle=Science and Technology in World History: An Introduction|\nlocation=Baltimore, Maryland | publisher=JHU Press\n\n | year=2006 | isbn=0-8018-8360-1}}\n | [http://books.google.com/books?id=aJgp94zNwNQC&printsec=frontcover#PPA8 Page\n | 6â12 ] The Paleolithic is characterized by the use of knapped stone\n | tools, although at the time humans also used wood and bone tools. Other\n | organic commodities were adapted for use as tools, including leather and\n | vegetable fibers; however, due to their nature, these have not been preserved\n | to any great degree. Surviving artifacts of the Paleolithic era are known as\n | paleoliths. Humankind gradually evolved from early members of the genus\n | [[Homo genus|Homo]] such as [[Homo habilis]] â who used simple stone\n | tools â into fully behaviorally and anatomically modern humans ([[Homo\n | sapiens sapiens]]) during the Paleolithic era.

Potts, B.A., Ph.D. During the end of the Paleolithic,\n | specifically the Middle and or Upper Paleolithic, humans began to produce the\n | earliest works of art and engage in religious and spiritual behavior such as\n | burial and ritual. The climate during the Paleolithic consisted of a set of glacial\n | and interglacial periods in which the climate periodically fluctuated between\n | warm and cool temperatures.\n\nThe term \"\" was coined by archaeologist John Lubbock in 1865.

It derives from Greek: , palaios, \"old\"; and , lithos,\n\"stone\", literally meaning \"old age of the stone\" or \"Old Stone Age.\"\n\nOne rich source of Paleothic artifacts has been the Euphrates river valley.\nExcavations started in the 1960s, when the Turkish government built the Keban\ndam on the river. The Keban historical salvage project was organized by Kemal\nKurdas, then rector of Middle East Technical University, and a team of Turkish,\nAmerican and Dutch archeologists led by Maurits van Loon excavated. Later, more\ndams were built and salvage operations took place, unearthing settlements going\nback to the Paleolithic.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"paleolithic","recorded":1376428819,"links":[],"instances":["geology","latitude","anatomy","device","producer","paleolithic_site","mythology","alaska","archaeological_site"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Paleolithic|","Pleistocene"],"headings":["Human
