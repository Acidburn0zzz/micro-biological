(31 January 1881 â 16 August\n1957) was an American chemist and physicist. His most noted publication was the\nfamous 1919 article \"The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules\" in\nwhich, building on Gilbert N. Lewis's cubical atom theory and Walther Kossel's\nchemical bonding theory, he outlined his \"concentric theory of atomic\nstructure\". Langmuir, I. (1919). \"[http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Langmuir-\n1919b.html The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules]\", Journal of the\nAmerican Chemical Society. Vol. 41, No. 6, 868. Langmuir became embroiled\nin a priority dispute with Lewis over this work; Langmuir's presentation skills\nwere largely responsible for the popularization of the theory, although the\ncredit for the theory itself belongs mostly to Lewis. Patrick Coffey,\nCathedrals of Science: The Personalities and Rivalries That Made Modern\nChemistry, Oxford University Press, 2008: 134-146 While at General\nElectric, from 1909â1950, Langmuir advanced several basic fields of physics and\nchemistry, invented the gas-filled incandescent lamp, the hydrogen welding\ntechnique, and was awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in\nsurface chemistry. The Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research near\nSocorro, New Mexico, was named in his honor as was the American Chemical Society\njournal for Surface Science, called Langmuir.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Irving_Langmuir","recorded":1376423405,"links":[],"instances":["journal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1881 births","1957 deaths","American agnostics","American physical chemists","American meteorologists","American people of English descent","American people of Scottish descent","American people of Welsh descent","Foreign Members of the Royal Society","Columbia University alumni","Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science alumni","University of Göttingen alumni","General Electric people","Nobel laureates in Chemistry","American Nobel laureates","People from Schenectady, New York","Faraday Lecturers","National Academy of Sciences laureates","Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences"],"headings":["Biography","Honors","Patents","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["langmuir","journal"],["plasma","physics"],["plasma","physics#temperatures"],["plasma","physics#degree_of_ionization"]],"members":["plasma","langmuir"],"related":["Brooklyn,_New_York","Woods_Hole,_Massachusetts","Chemistry","Physics","General_Electric","Columbia_University","University_of_Göttingen","Walther_Nernst","Franklin_Medal","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Perkin_Medal","Chemistry","Physics","Gilbert_N._Lewis","Cubical_atom","Walther_Kossel","General_Electric","Physics","Chemistry","Incandescent_lamp","Atomic_hydrogen_welding","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Surface_chemistry","Langmuir_Laboratory_for_Atmospheric_Research","Socorro,_New_Mexico","American_Chemical_Society","Langmuir_(journal)","Brooklyn","Chestnut_Hill_Academy","Metallurgical_engineering","Metallurgy","Columbia_University","Columbia_University_School_of_Mines","Fu_Foundation_School_of_Engineering_and_Applied_Science","Walther_Nernst","Göttingen","Nernst_glower","Stevens_Institute_of_Technology","Hoboken,_New_Jersey","General_Electric","Schenectady,_New_York","Diffusion_pump","Vacuum_tube","Lewi_Tonks","Tungsten","Inert_gas","Argon","Incandescent_light_bulb","William_Comings_White","Thermionic_emission","Plasma_(physics)","Blood_plasma","Langmuir_wave","Langmuir_probe","Hydrogen","Atomic_hydrogen_welding","Gas_tungsten_arc_welding","World_War_I","Valence_shell","Isotope","Institute_of_Radio_Engineers","Langmuir-Taylor_detector","Katharine_B._Blodgett","Monolayer","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Surface_chemistry","Atmospheric_science","Meteorology","Deer_botfly","Windrow","Sargasso_Sea","Langmuir_circulation","World_War_II","Sonar","Deicing","Dry_ice","Iodide","Cloud_seeding","Pathological_science","Scientific_method","Pseudoscience","Extra-sensory_perception","Flying_saucers","Polywater","Cold_fusion","Irving_Langmuir_House","National_Historic_Landmark","Woods_Hole,_Massachusetts","Kurt_Vonnegut","Ice-nine","Bernard_Vonnegut","American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences","Perkin_Medal","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Franklin_Medal","Faraday_Medal","John_J._Carty_Award_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","Stony_Brook_University","18-Electron_rule","Irving_Langmuir_House","Langmuir_isotherm","Langmuir_probe","Langmuir-Taylor_detector","Child-Langmuir_Law","Langmuir_Trough","Langmuir_circulation","Langmuir_equation","Langmuir_wave","Langmuir_states","Brooklyn,_New_York","Woods_Hole,_Massachusetts"]}
