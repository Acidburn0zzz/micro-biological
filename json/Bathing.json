It may be practised for\npersonal hygiene, religious ritual or therapeutic purposes or as a\nrecreational activity.\n\nBathing can take place in any situation where there is water, ranging from warm\nto cold. It can take place in a bathtub or shower, or it can be in a river,\nlake, water hole, pool or the sea, or any other water receptacle. The term for\nthe act can vary. It is best taken place during the times from early night\n(civil darkness) through early morning (civil daylight). For example, a ritual\nreligious bath is sometimes referred to as immersion, the use of water for\ntherapeutic purposes can be called water treatment or hydrotherapy, and two\nrecreational water activities are known as swimming and paddling. The city of\nBath (known during ancient Roman times as [[Aquae Sulis]]) is famous for its\npublic baths fed by hydrothermal springs.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Bathing","recorded":1376428451,"links":[],"instances":["book_of_daniel","material","arts"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bathing|","Babycare","Nudity"],"headings":["Purpose","Types of baths","Clothing","Bathing babies","Western history","Japanese bathing culture","Bathing in Mesoamerica","Art motif","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["sponge","material"],["sponge","material"],["susanna","book_of_daniel"],["realism","arts"]],"members":["susanna","sponge","realism"],"related":["Washing","Fluid","Water","Personal_hygiene","Ritual","Therapy","Recreational","Bathtub","Shower","Hydrotherapy","Human_swimming","Bath,_Somerset","Ancient_Roman","Hydrothermal_springs","Personal_hygiene","Cleanliness","Body_odor","Ritual","Hydrotherapy","Rite","Baptism","Bathtub","Shower","Quality_of_water","Soap","Public_bathing","Turkish_bath","Sauna","Whirlpool","Sponge_(material)","Sponge_(material)","Nudity","Social_norm","Swimsuit","Sex_segregation","Sex_segregation","Skinny_dipping","Baby_bath","Asthma","Eczema","American_Academy_of_Pediatrics","Red-figure_pottery","Stamnos","Pozzuoli","Ancient_Greece","Knossos","Akrotiri","Santorini","Roman_aqueduct","Ancient_Roman_bathing","Thermae","Decline_of_the_Roman_Empire","Middle_Ages","Public_bathing","Prostitution","Renaissance","Protestant_Reformation","Miasma_theory_of_disease","Laundress","Ottoman_Empire","Germ_theory","Microorganism","London_water_supply_infrastructure","Cholera","Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_France","Hospitality","Asuka_period","Nara_period","Mixed_bathing","Art_nude","Bathsheba_at_Her_Bath","Susanna_(Book_of_Daniel)","Renaissance","Baroque","Titian","François_Boucher","Classicism","Realism_(arts)","Impressionism","Edgar_Degas","Turkish_bath","Lawrence_Alma-Tadema","William-Adolphe_Bouguereau","François_Boucher","Paul_Cézanne","Gustave_Courbet","Lucas_Cranach_the_Younger","Edgar_Degas","Albrecht_Dürer","Anthonis_van_Dyck","Jean-Léon_Gérôme","Jean-Auguste-Dominique_Ingres","Édouard_Manet","Pierre-Auguste_Renoir","Sebastiano_Ricci","Domenico_Tintoretto","Tizian","Anders_Zorn","Lucas_Cranach_the_Younger","Tizian","Wolfgang_Heimbach","François_Boucher","Jean_Auguste_Dominique_Ingres","Jean-Léon_Gérôme","Edgar_Degas","Lawrence_Alma-Tadema","Anders_Zorn","Balneotherapy","Destination_spa","Navy_shower","Sea_bathing","Sentō","Spa","Thermae","Willy_Puchner"]}
