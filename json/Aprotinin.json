Under the trade name 'Trasylol', aprotinin was\nused as a medication administered by injection to reduce bleeding during complex\nsurgery, such as heart and liver surgery. Its main effect is the slowing down of\nfibrinolysis, the process that leads to the breakdown of blood clots. The aim in\nits use was to decrease the need for blood transfusions during surgery, as well\nas end-organ damage due to hypotension (low blood pressure) as a result of\nmarked blood loss. The drug was temporarily withdrawn worldwide in 2007 after\nstudies suggested that its use increased the risk of complications or\ndeath; this was confirmed by follow-up studies. Trasylol sales were\nsuspended in May 2008, except for very restricted research use. In February 2012\nthe European Medicines Agency (EMA) scientific committee reverted its previous\nstandpoint regarding aprotinin, and has recommended that the suspension be\nlifted.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Aprotinin","recorded":1376427641,"links":[],"instances":["chemistry","biology","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Antifibrinolytics","Proteins","Withdrawn drugs"],"headings":["Chemistry","Mechanism of drug action","Drug efficacy","Drug safety","In vitro use","History","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["injection","medicine"],["base","chemistry"],["homogenization","biology"]],"members":["base","homogenization","injection"],"related":["Intravenous","Bayer","Trypsin","Enzyme","Medication","Injection_(medicine)","Bleeding","Surgery","Fibrinolysis","Blood_transfusion","Hypotension","European_Medicines_Agency","Polypeptide","Molecular_weight","Amino_acid","Alpha_helix","Base_(chemistry)","Disulfide_bond","Cysteine","Lysine","Kunitz-type_protease_inhibitor","Serine_protease","Trypsin","Chymotrypsin","Plasmin","Kallikrein","Kallikrein","Factor_XII","Liver_transplantation","Meta-analysis","Coronary_artery_bypass_graft","Anaphylaxis","Serology","Thrombosis","Acute_renal_failure","Myocardial_infarction","Heart_failure","Stroke","Encephalopathy","Tranexamic_acid","Aminocaproic_acid","Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy","Glucagon","Enzyme_inhibitor","Chemical_decomposition","Lysis","Homogenization_(biology)","Parotid_gland","Acute_pancreatitis","Structural_biology","Protein_folding","Robert_Huber","Protein_structure","Protein_nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy","Kurt_Wuthrich","Molecular_dynamics","J._Andrew_McCammon","Martin_Karplus","Protein_folding","MEROPS"]}
