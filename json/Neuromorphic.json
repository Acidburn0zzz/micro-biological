{"cursor":"7519","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Neuromorphic engineering', also known as 'neuromorphic computing', is a concept\ndeveloped by Carver Mead, in the late 1980s, describing the use of very-large-\nscale integration (VLSI) systems containing electronic analog circuits to mimic\nneuro-biological architectures present in the nervous system. In recent times\nthe term neuromorphic has been used to describe analog, digital, and mixed-mode\nanalog/digital VLSI and software systems that implement models of neural systems\n(for perception, motor control, or sensory integration).\n\nA key aspect of neuromorphic engineering is understanding how the morphology of\nindividual neurons, circuits and overall architectures creates desirable\ncomputations, affects how information is represented, influences robustness to\ndamage, incorporates learning and development, adapts to local change\n(plasticity), and facilitates evolutionary change.\n\nNeuromorphic engineering is a new interdisciplinary discipline that takes\ninspiration from biology, physics, mathematics, computer science and engineering\nto design artificial neural systems, such as vision systems, head-eye systems,\nauditory processors, and autonomous robots, whose physical architecture and\ndesign principles are based on those of biological nervous systems. Boddhu,\nSanjay K., et al (2012). \"Qualitative functional decomposition analysis of\nevolved neuromorphic flight controllers.\" Applied Computational Intelligence and\nSoft Computing 2012 (2012): 2.\n\nAn example of neuromorphic computer hardware is the Neurogrid board built by the\nBrains in Silicon group at Stanford University.\n\nIn November 2011, a group of MIT researchers created the first computer chip\nthat mimics the analog, ion-based communication in a synapse between two neurons\nusing 400 transistors and standard CMOS manufacturing techniques.\n\nIn June 2012, Spintronic Researchers at Purdue presented a paper on design for a\nneuromorphic chip using lateral spin valves and memristors. They argue that the\narchitecture they have designed works in a similar way to neurons and can\ntherefore be used to test various ways of reproducing the brainâs processing\nability. In addition, they are significantly more energy efficient than\nconventional chips.\n\nNeuromorphic engineers have become particularly interested in spike-timing-\ndependent plasticity, and its deviations in VLSI, and its applications in\nrobotics, brain machine interfaces, and cognition. In March 2013, neuromorphic\nresearchers proposed an analog VLSI model of STDP that follows both spike timing\nand rate based synaptic plasticity rules and can be utilized in VLSI\nimplementation of large scale spiking neural networks. [http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0090 Analog VLSI model of STDP]\n\nA research project with implications for neuromorphic engineering is the Human\nBrain Project, a 10 year collaboration that is attempting to simulate a complete\nhuman brain in a supercomputer using biological data. It is made up of a group\nof researchers in neuroscience, medicine, and computing. Henry\nMarkram, the project's co-director, has stated that the project is proposing to\nestablish a new foundation, to explore and understand the brain and its\ndiseases, and to use that knowledge to build new computing technologies. The\nthree primary goals of the project are to better understand how the pieces of\nthe brain fit and work together, to understand how to objectively diagnose and\ntreat brain diseases, and to use the understanding of the human brain to develop\nneuromorphic computers. The simulation of a complete human brain will take\nsupercomputers a thousand times more powerful than today's, and thus the focus\non neuromorphic computers. $1.3 billion has been allocated to the\nproject by The European Commission.\n\nAnother research project with implications for neuromorphic engineering is the\nBRAIN Initiative.
