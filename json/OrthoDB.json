Orthology\nrefers to the last common ancestor of the species under consideration, and thus\nOrthoDB explicitly delineates orthologs at each radiation along the species\nphylogeny. The database of orthologs presents available protein descriptors,\ntogether with Gene Ontology and InterPro attributes, which serve to provide\ngeneral descriptive annotations of the orthologous groups, and facilitate\ncomprehensive orthology database querying. OrthoDB also provides computed\nevolutionary traits of orthologs, such as gene duplicability and loss profiles,\ndivergence rates, and sibling groups, now extended to detail intron-exon\narchitectures, syntenic orthologs, and parent-child trees.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"OrthoDB","recorded":1376418397,"links":[],"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biological databases","Evolutionary biology","Phylogenetics"],"headings":["Methodology","Data content","Performance","Notes and references","See also","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["homology","biology"],["homology","biology"]],"members":["homology"],"related":["Orthologs","Swiss_Institute_of_Bioinformatics","Homology_(biology)","Arthropods","Fungi","Bacteria","Gene_Ontology","InterPro","Maximum_likelihood","Smithâ€“Waterman_algorithm","Ensembl","UniProt","National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","FlyBase","Homology_(biology)","Phylogeny","List_of_biological_databases"]}
