Malachite green is\ntraditionally used as a dye for materials such as silk, leather, and paper.\nAlthough called malachite green, the compound is not related to the mineral\nmalachite â€” the name just comes from the similarity of color.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Malachite_green","recorded":1376428367,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Triarylmethane dyes","Staining dyes","PH indicators","Antifungals","Aromatic amines","Fish health"],"headings":["Structures and properties","Preparation","Uses","Regulation","Toxicity","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Organic_compound","Dyestuff","Aquaculture","Silk","Leather","Paper","Mineral","Malachite","Triarylmethane_dye","Cation","Oxalate","Anion","Extinction_coefficient","Benzaldehyde","Dimethylaniline","Triphenylmethane","Manganese_dioxide","Benzaldehyde","Dimethylaniline","Dehydrating_agent","Ullmann's_Encyclopedia_of_Industrial_Chemistry","Wiley-VCH","Oomycete","Saprolegnia","Aquaculture","Parasiticide","Antibacterial","Ichthyophthirius","Freshwater","Aquarium","Metabolite","Aquaculture","Hong_Kong","Eel","China","Taiwan","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Metabolism","Catfish","DNA_adducts","Adenoma","Liver_tumor"]}
