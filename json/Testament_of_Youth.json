It was published in 1933. Brittain's memoir\ncontinues with Testament of Experience, published in 1957, and encompassing the\nyears 1925â1950. Between these two books comes Testament of Friendship\n(published in 1940), which is essentially a memoir of Brittain's close colleague\nand friend, Winifred Holtby. A final segment of memoir, to be called 'Testament\nof Faith' or 'Testament of Time' was planned by Brittain but remained unfinished\nat her death.\n\nTestament of Youth has been acclaimed as a classic for its description of the\nimpact of World War I on the lives of women and the middle-class civilian\npopulation of Great Britain. The book shows how the impact extended into the\npostwar years. It is also considered a classic in feminist literature for its\ndepiction of a woman's pioneer struggle to forge an independent career in a\nsociety only grudgingly tolerant of educated women.\n\nIn the foreword, Brittain describes how she originally intended to write of her\nexperiences as a novel but was unable to achieve the objective distance from her\nsubject necessary. She then tried to publish her original diary from the war\nyears but with all names fictionalised. This too proved unworkable. Only then\ndid she decide to write her own personal story, putting her own experiences in\nthe wider historic and social context. Several critics have noted the cathartic\nprocess by which she deals with her grief in the writing.\n\nThe narrative begins with Vera's plans to enter the University of Oxford and her\nromance with Roland Leighton, a friend of her brother Edward. Both were\ncommissioned as officers early in World War I, and both were subsequently\nkilled, as were several other members of their social circle.\n\nThe book's main subject is Vera's work as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse,\nnursing wounded in London, Malta and at Etaples in France. It also describes how\nshe returned, disillusioned, to Somerville College, Oxford after the war and\ncompleted her BA degree. It covers the beginning of her career in journalism,\nwriting for [[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]] and lecturing for the\nLeague of Nations. She visits the graves of her brother Edward in Italy and her\nfiancÃ© Roland in France. Together with Winifred Holtby she toured the defeated\nand occupied regions of Germany and Austria in 1923.\n\nIt concludes with her meeting her husband George Catlin and their eventual\nmarriage in 1925.\n\nThe diaries on which the book is partly based, Chronicle of Youth, edited by\nAlan Bishope, were published in 1981. In 1998, the war letters which Brittain\nalso drew on in her autobiography were published in an edition by Alan Bishop\nand Mark Bostridge. Entitled Letters from a Lost Generation, their appearance\nwas met with considerable acclaim.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Testament_of_Youth","recorded":1376425034,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Testament_of_Youth&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Testament_of_Youth&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testament_of_Youth","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Testament_of_Youth&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Testament_of_Youth_Book_Cover.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e2/Testament_of_Youth_Book_Cover.jpg/175px-Testament_of_Youth_Book_Cover.jpg","/wiki/Vera_Brittain","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/Autobiography","/wiki/Victor_Gollancz","/wiki/Hardback","/wiki/Paperback","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Memoir","/wiki/Vera_Brittain","/wiki/Winifred_Holtby","/wiki/World_War_I","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Cathartic","/wiki/Grief","/wiki/University_of_Oxford","/wiki/Roland_Leighton","/wiki/Voluntary_Aid_Detachment","/wiki/Somerville_College","/wiki/Time_and_Tide_(magazine)","/wiki/League_of_Nations","/wiki/Winifred_Holtby","/wiki/George_Catlin_(political_scientist)","/wiki/Mark_Bostridge","#Publishing_history","#Adaptations","#Other_sources","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Testament_of_Youth&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Testament_of_Youth&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0860680355","/wiki/Special:BookSources/8606803553","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0006357032","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0872236722","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0872236722","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0143039237","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0860680355","/w/index.php?title=Testament_of_Youth&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Testament_of_Youth&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/Elaine_Morgan_(writer)","/wiki/BBC_Two","/wiki/Cheryl_Campbell","/wiki/Peter_Woodward","/wiki/Joanna_McCallum","/wiki/Emrys_James","/wiki/Jane_Wenham_(actress)","/wiki/Armistice","/wiki/BBC_Radio_Four","/wiki/Amanda_Root","/wiki/Rupert_Graves","/wiki/David_Heyman","/wiki/Shirley_Williams","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Saoirse_Ronan","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Testament_of_Youth&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Testament_of_Youth&veaction=edit&section=3","http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1031689,00.html","http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=m6SBFRVOppIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA169&dq=Testament+of+Youth+&ots=VRsMblUQxk&sig=GoHTyWYrpsmIgSDQu5SZf6OHnSI#PPA169,M1","http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=LLLL2Qn7ZnQmMLCyfYSYYmJNv5hYyL35nP1QtGsx81YdGT1yn0xw!-500149612?docId=5006388280","/w/index.php?title=Testament_of_Youth&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Testament_of_Youth&veaction=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/9228971/Veras-Testament-is-young-again.html","/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph","#cite_ref-2","http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/4612365/Vera-Brittain-to-be-subject-of-film.html","/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph","#cite_ref-3","http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/cannes-film-festival/9278259/Cannes-2012-BBC-to-dramatise-life-of-WW1-writer-Vera-Brittain.html","/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph","/w/index.php?title=Testament_of_Youth&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Testament_of_Youth&veaction=edit&section=5","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078699/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Testament_of_Youth&oldid=564009125","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1933_books","/wiki/Category:British_autobiographies","/wiki/Category:History_books_about_World_War_I","/wiki/Category:Masterpiece_Theatre","/wiki/Category:Personal_accounts_of_World_War_I","/wiki/Category:Anti-war_books","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_December_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_
