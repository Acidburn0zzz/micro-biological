All of\nthe contents of the cells of prokaryote organisms (such as bacteria, which lack\na cell nucleus) are contained within the cytoplasm. Within the cells of\neukaryote organisms the contents of the cell nucleus are separated from the\ncytoplasm, and are then called the nucleoplasm. The cytoplasm is about 70% to\n90% water and usually colorless.\n\nIt is within the cytoplasm that most cellular activities occur, such as many\nmetabolic pathways including glycolysis, and processes such as cell division.\nThe inner, granular mass is called the endoplasm and the outer, clear and glassy\nlayer is called the cell cortex or the ectoplasm.\n\nMovement of calcium ions in and out of the cytoplasm is thought to be a\nsignaling activity for metabolic processes.
