Its upper part connects with the last lumbar vertebra, and bottom part\nwith the coccyx (tailbone). It consists of usually five initially unfused\nvertebrae which begin to fuse between ages 16â18 and are usually completely\nfused into a single bone by age 34.\n\nIt is curved upon itself and placed obliquely (that is, tilted forward). It is\nkyphoticâthat is, facing forward. The base projects forward as the sacral\npromontory internally, and articulates with the last lumbar vertebra to form the\nprominent sacrovertebral angle. The central part is curved outward toward the\nposterior, allowing greater room for the pelvic cavity. The two lateral\nprojections of the sacrum are called ala (wings), and articulate with the ilium\nat the L-shaped sacroiliac joints.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"sacrum","recorded":1376418387,"links":[],"instances":["comparative_religion","bone","anatomy","croup","anatomy","disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bones of the torso","Irregular bones","Sacrum|","Vertebral column"],"headings":["Etymology","Parts","Articulations","Diagnosis","Sexual dimorphism","Variations","Additional images","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["insertion","anatomy"],["kyphosis","disambiguation"],["posterior","anatomy"],["ilium","bone"],["sacred","comparative_religion"],["ilium","bone"],["ilium","bone"],["rump","croup"],["ilium","bone"]],"members":["sacred","ilium","insertion","rump","posterior","kyphosis"],"related":["Pelvis","Bone","Vertebral_column","Pelvic_cavity","Insertion_(anatomy)","Hip_bones","Lumbar_vertebrae","Coccyx","Kyphosis_(disambiguation)","Sacral_promontory","Sacrovertebral_angle","Posterior_(anatomy)","Pelvic_cavity","Ilium_(bone)","Sacroiliac_joint","Latin","Sacred_(comparative_religion)","Greek_language","Reproductive_organs","Slavic_languages","German_language","Pelvic_surface_of_sacrum","Dorsal_surface_of_sacrum","Lateral_surface_of_sacrum","Base_of_the_sacrum","Coccyx","Vertebral_canal","Sacral_nerve","Lumbar_vertebra","Coccyx","Ilium_(bone)","Hip_bone","Ilium_(bone)","Sagittal_plane","Sexual_dimorphism","Terms_for_anatomical_location","Pelvimetry","Rump_(croup)","Coccyx","Ilium_(bone)","Lumbarization"]}
