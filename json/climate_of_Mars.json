{"cursor":"64997","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n as seen by Viking 1, 22 February 1980]] The 'climate of Mars' has been an issue\n of scientific curiosity for centuries, not least because Mars is the only\n terrestrial planet whose surface can be directly observed in detail from the\n Earth with help from a telescope.\n\nAlthough Mars is smaller at 11% of Earth's mass and 50% farther from the Sun\nthan the Earth, its climate has important similarities, such as the polar ice\ncaps, seasonal changes and the observable presence of weather patterns. It has\nattracted sustained study from planetologists and climatologists. Although\nMars's climate has similarities to Earth's, including seasons and periodic ice\nages, there are also important differences such as the absence of liquid water\n(though frozen water exists) and much lower thermal inertia. Mars' atmosphere\nhas a scale height of approximately , 60% greater than that on Earth. The\nclimate is of considerable relevance to the question of whether life is or was\npresent on the planet, and briefly received more interest in the news due to\nNASA measurements indicating increased sublimation of the south polar icecap\nleading to some popular press speculation that Mars was undergoing a parallel\nbout of global warming.\n\nMars has been studied by Earth-based instruments since as early as the 17th\ncentury but it is only since the exploration of Mars began in the mid-1960s that\nclose-range observation has been possible. Flyby and orbital spacecraft have\nprovided data from above, while direct measurements of atmospheric conditions\nhave been provided by a number of landers and rovers. Advanced Earth orbital\ninstruments today continue to provide some useful \"big picture\" observations of\nrelatively large weather phenomena.\n\nThe first Martian flyby mission was Mariner 4 which arrived in 1965. That\nquick two day pass (July 14â15, 1965) was limited and crude in terms of its\ncontribution to the state of knowledge of Martian climate. Later Mariner\nmissions (Mariner 6, and Mariner 7) filled in some of the gaps in basic\nclimate information. Data based climate studies started in earnest with the\nViking program in 1975 and continues with such probes as the Mars\nReconnaissance Orbiter.\n\nThis observational work has been complemented by a type of scientific computer\nsimulation called the Mars General Circulation Model. {{cite web | title =\nMars General Circulation Modeling\n               | author = NASA publisher = NASA url =
