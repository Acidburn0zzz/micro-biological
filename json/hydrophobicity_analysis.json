Wetting is a relatively fascinating field of\nsurface science to study since it deals with the three phases of materials: gas,\nliquid and solid. It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and nano-\nscience studies due to the advent of many nano-materials in the past 2 decades\n(e.g. graphene J Rafiee, X Mi, H Gullapalli, AV Thomas, F Yavari, Y Shi, PM\nAjayan, NA Koratkar, Wetting transparency of graphene, Nature Materials 11 (3),\n217-222. , carbon nano-tube).\n\nWetting is important in the bonding or adherence of two materials. Wetting and\nthe surface forces that control wetting are also responsible for other related\neffects, including so-called capillary effects. Regardless of the amount of\nwetting, the shape of a liquid drop on a rigid surface is roughly a truncated\nsphere. Various degrees of wetting are summarized in this article.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"hydrophobicity_analysis","recorded":1376428520,"links":[],"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fluid mechanics"],"headings":["Explanation","High-energy vs. low-energy surfaces","Ideal solid surfaces","Non-ideal rough solid surfaces","Spreading Dynamics","Effect of surfactants on wetting","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["cohesion","chemistry"],["cohesion","chemistry"]],"members":["cohesion"],"related":["Liquid","Solid","Surface","Intermolecular","Adhesion","Cohesion_(chemistry)","Force","Graphene","Carbon_nano_tube","Chemical_bond","Adhesion","Capillary_action","Spherical_cap","Adhesive","Liquid","Solid","Surface","Cohesion_(chemistry)","Contact_angle","Water","Hydrophilic","Hydrophobic","Lotus_effect","Energy","Glass","Ceramic","Chemical_bond","Van_der_Waals_force","William_Zisman","Surface_tension","Rectilinear","Organic_compound","Critical_surface_tension","Hysteresis","Thermodynamic_equilibrium","Force","Triangle","Young_equation","Solid","Liquid","Gas","Droplet","Immiscible","Wenzel_model","Roughness_ratio","Young_contact_angle","Intrinsic","Cassie's_law","Lotus_effect","Cassie's_law","Wetting_transition","Surface_tension","Viscosity","Density","Gravitational_constant","Surfactants","Adsorption","Amott_index","Anti-fog","Contact_angle","Dewetting","Electrowetting","Buoyancy","Sessile_drop_technique"]}
