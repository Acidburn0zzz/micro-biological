The composition of sand is highly variable,\ndepending on the local rock sources and conditions, but the most common\nconstituent of sand in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal\nsettings is silica (silicon dioxide, or SiO 2), usually in the form\nof quartz.\n\nThe second most common type of sand is calcium carbonate, for example aragonite,\nwhich has mostly been created, over the past half billion years, by various\nforms of life, like coral and shellfish. It is, for example, the primary form of\nsand apparent in areas where reefs have dominated the ecosystem for millions of\nyears like the Caribbean.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Sand","recorded":1376428510,"links":[],"instances":["grain_size","geology","crystalline","landform","masonry","geology","material","color"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sand| Sand"],"headings":["Composition","Environments","Study","Uses","Alternatives to natural sand","Hazards","Environmental issues","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["rock","geology"],["particle_size","grain_size"],["particle_size","grain_size"],["bar","landform"],["bar","landform"],["grus","geology"],["cob","material"],["mortar","masonry"],["texture","crystalline"],["mortar","masonry"],["desert_sand","color"]],"members":["particle_size","grus","texture","bar","mortar","rock","cob","desert_sand"],"related":["Granular","Material","Rock_(geology)","Mineral","Tropical","Coastal","Silica","Quartz","Calcium_carbonate","Aragonite","Coral","Shellfish","Caribbean","Utah","Quartz","Hematite","Quartz","Chert","Igneous_rock","Particle_size_(grain_size)","Geologist","Gravel","Silt","Albert_Atterberg","American_Association_of_State_Highway_and_Transportation_Officials","United_States_Department_of_Agriculture","Flour","International_Organization_for_Standardization","Particle_size_(grain_size)","Silica","Quartz","Mineral","Weathering","Coral_sand","Limestone","Coral","Seashell","Organism","Gypsum","White_Sands_National_Monument","New_Mexico","Arkose","Sandstone","Feldspar","Weathering","Erosion","Granite","Magnetite","Chlorite_group","Glauconite","Gypsum","Magnetite","Basalt","Obsidian","Chlorite_group","Glauconite","Basaltic","Lava","Olivine","Southern_Europe","Iron","Crystals","Garnet","Gemstone","Beach","Dune","Bar_(landform)","Bar_(landform)","Natural_environment","Gravel","Rivers","Glacial_moraine","Platte_River","Nebraska","USA","Sediment_transport","Soil_texture","Quartz_sand","Granite","Gneiss","Grus_(geology)","Arenophile","Agriculture","Soil","Aquarium","Reef_tank","Aragonite","Coral","Shellfish","Artificial_reefs","Geotextile","Artificial_island","Persian_Gulf","Beach_nourishment","Beach","Brick","Clay","Cob_(material)","Mortar_(masonry)","Concrete","Hydraulic_Fracturing","Glass","Paint","Texture_(crystalline)","Railroad_engineer","Sand_animation","Performance_art","Sand_casting","Molding_sand","Foundry","Sand_castle","Sandbag","Sandblasting","Abrasive","Early_thermal_weapons","Media_filter","Zoanthid","Benthic","Cnidaria","Coral","Sea_anemone","Mesoglea","Gravel","Mortar_(masonry)","Sandblasting","Material_safety_data_sheet","Pore_water_pressure","Quicksand","Colloid","Hydrogel","Dredging","Beach","Construction_aggregate","Desert_sand_(color)","Dry_quicksand","Dust_storm","Heavy_mineral_sands_ore_deposits","Oil_sands","Particle_size","Quicksand","Sand_island","Sand_Rat","Sandstone","Singing_sand","White_Sands_National_Monument","Beaufort_County,_SC"]}
