Specialists\nsometimes call the grizzly the 'North American brown bear' because the grizzly\nand the brown bear are one species on two continents. In\nsome places, some may nickname the grizzly the 'silvertip' for the silvery,\ngrizzly sheen in its fur.\n\nSince the mainland grizzly is so widespread, it is representative and archetypal\nfor the whole subspecific group. Even so, classification is being revised along\ngenetic lines.\n\nExcept for cubs and females, [http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/grizzly-\nbear/ Grizzly Bears, Grizzly Bear Pictures, Grizzly Bear Facts â National\nGeographic].
