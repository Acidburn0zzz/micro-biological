It was introduced\nby James Baker. \n\nSUS is a development of fitness proportionate selection (FPS) which exhibits no\nbias and minimal spread. Where FPS chooses several solutions from the population\nby repeated random sampling, SUS uses a single random value to sample all of the\nsolutions by choosing them at 'evenly spaced intervals'. This gives weaker\nmembers of the population (according to their fitness) a chance to be chosen and\nthus reduces the unfair nature of fitness-proportional selection methods.\n\nOther methods like roulette wheel can have bad performance when a member of the\npopulation has a really large fitness in comparison with other members. Using a\ncomb-like ruler, SUS starts from a small random number, and chooses the next\ncandidates from the rest of population remaining, not allowing the fittest\nmembers to saturate the candidate space.\n\nDescribed as an algorithm, pseudocode for SUS looks like:\n\n SUS('Population', 'N') 'F' := total fitness of 'population' 'N' := number\nof offspring to keep 'P' := distance between the pointers ('F'/'N') 'Start' :=\nrandom number between 0 and 'P' 'Pointers' := ['Start' + 'i'*'P' | 'i' in [0..'N'-\n1]] return RWS('Population','Pointers')\n\n RWS('Population', 'Points') 'Keep' = [] 'i' := 0 'for P' in 'Points' 'while'\n fitness of 'Population[i]' \n\nHere RWS() describes the bulk of fitness proportionate selection (also known as\n\"roulette wheel selection\") - in true fitness proportional selection the\nparameter 'Points' is always a (sorted) list of random numbers from 0 to 'F'.\nThe algorithm above is intended to be illustrative rather than canonical.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"stochastic_universal_sampling","recorded":1376428017,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetic algorithms","Stochastic algorithms"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Genetic_algorithm","Fitness_proportionate_selection","Roulette_wheel","Fitness_proportionate_selection","Reward-based_selection"]}
