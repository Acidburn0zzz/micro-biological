He received a Ph.D (Dr.phil.nat.)\nfrom Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main in 1931 for his\nthesis on the chemistry of the bile acids. After studying at Oriel College,\nOxford he gained another doctorate in (1933) and held posts with the Lister\nInstitute, the University of Edinburgh (staff, 1934-1936) and the University of\nLondon, where he was appointed Reader in Biochemistry.\n\nTodd became the Sir Samuel Hall Professor of Chemistry and Director of the\nChemical Laboratories of the University of Manchester in 1938, where he began\nworking on nucleosides, compounds that form the structural units of nucleic\nacids (DNA and RNA). In 1944 he was appointed to the 1702 Chair of Chemistry in\nthe University of Cambridge, which he held until his retirement in 1971, after a\nheart attack. {{citation|title=The 1702 chair of chemistry at Cambridge:\ntransformation and change |first=Mary D. |last=Archer|authorlink=Mary\nArcher|first2= Christopher D. |last2=Haley |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-521-82873-\n2}}, Chapter 9: Alexander Todd, p 233 In 1949 he synthesized adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD).\n\nIn 1955 he elucidated the structure of vitamin B 12 , later working on\nthe structure and synthesis of vitamin B 1 and vitamin E, the\nanthocyanins (the pigments of flowers and fruits) from insects (aphids,\nbeetles) and studied alkaloids found in hashish and marijuana. He served as\nchairman of the British government's advisory committee on scientific policy\nfrom 1952 to 1964.\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge in 1944 and was Master\nfrom 1963 to 1978. He became Chancellor of the University of Strathclyde in\n1975, and a visiting professor at Hatfield Polytechnic (1978â1986). Among his\nmany honours, including over 40 honorary degrees, he was elected as a Fellow of\nthe Royal Society in 1942, was President of the Royal Society from 1975 to 1980\nand became a member of the Royal Order of Merit in 1977.\n\nHe was knighted as Sir Alexander Todd in 1954 and elevated to the peerage as\n'Baron Todd' of Trumpington in the County of Cambridgeshire in 1962.\n\nLord Todd was married to Alison Sarah, daughter of Nobel Prize winner Sir\nHenry Dale, and had a son, Alexander Henry, and two daughters, Helen Jean and\nHilary Alison.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Alexander_R._Todd,_Baron_Todd","recorded":1376418388,"links":[],"instances":["academic_rank","drug","education","organic_chemist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1907 births","1997 deaths","Academics of the University of Hertfordshire","Academics of the University of London","Academics of the Victoria University of Manchester","People educated at Allan Glen's School","Alumni of Oriel College, Oxford","Alumni of the University of Glasgow","British Nobel laureates","Fellows of Christ's College, Cambridge","Masters of Christ's College, Cambridge","Fellows of the Royal Society","Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh","Life peers","Members of the Order of Merit","Nobel laureates in Chemistry","People associated with the University of Strathclyde","People from Glasgow","Presidents of the Royal Society","Members of the Austrian Academy of Sciences","Foreign Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences","Foreign Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences","Scottish biochemists","Scottish biologists","Scottish chemists","Scottish Nobel laureates","Royal Medal winners","Recipients of the Copley Medal","Knights Bachelor","Presidents of the British Science Association"],"headings":["References","Bibliography","See also","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["robert_robinson","organic_chemist"],["reader","academic_rank"],["cannabis","drug"],["chancellor","education"]],"members":["reader","cannabis","chancellor","robert_robinson"],"related":["Cathcart,_Glasgow","Oakington,_Cambridgeshire","Scotland","Chemistry","Biochemistry","Lister_Institute","University_of_Edinburgh","University_of_London","University_of_Manchester","University_of_Cambridge","University_of_Strathclyde","Hatfield_Polytechnic","University_of_Glasgow","University_of_Frankfurt_am_Main","University_of_Oxford","Walter_Borsche","Robert_Robinson_(organic_chemist)","Nobel_Prize_for_Chemistry","Order_of_Merit","President_of_the_Royal_Society","FRSE","Scotland","Biochemist","Nucleotide","Nucleoside","Coenzyme","Nobel_Prize_for_Chemistry","Glasgow","Allan_Glen's_School","University_of_Glasgow","Bachelor's_degree","Doctorate","Johann_Wolfgang_Goethe_University_of_Frankfurt_am_Main","Bile","Oriel_College,_Oxford","Lister_Institute","University_of_Edinburgh","University_of_London","Reader_(academic_rank)","Biochemistry","Professor","Organic_chemistry","Victoria_University_of_Manchester","DNA","RNA","BP_Professor_of_Organic_Chemistry","University_of_Cambridge","Adenosine_triphosphate","FAD","Vitamin_B12","Vitamin_B1","Vitamin_E","Anthocyanins","Alkaloids","Hashish","Cannabis_(drug)","British_government","Science_policy","Fellow","Christ's_College,_Cambridge","Chancellor_(education)","University_of_Strathclyde","University_of_Hertfordshire","Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","President_of_the_Royal_Society","Order_of_Merit","Knight","Peerage","Trumpington,_Cambridgeshire","Henry_Hallett_Dale","David_Cannadine","The_Independent","New_York_Times","History_of_RNA_biology","List_of_RNA_biologists","Lewis_Wolpert","Cathcart,_Glasgow","Oakington,_Cambridgeshire"]}
