Smith was born in Leicester to John Bardell\nSmith, an engineer, and Ada Smith (nÃ©e Horrocks). He was educated at Wyggeston\nBoys' School (now Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College) until 1929, when the\nfamily moved to London. His education continued at Bec School, Tooting, for\nthree years, then at University College School, London. In 1935, although having\nfailed his Higher School Certificate, he was awarded an exhibition to Trinity\nCollege, Cambridge. He graduated in the Mathematical Tripos, with a First in\nPart II in 1937 and a Distinction in Part III in 1938. Following graduation he\nbegan postgraduate research, taking his Ph.D. in 1942.\n","linknr":157,"url":"Cedric_Smith_(statistician)","recorded":1376425853,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_Smith_(statistician)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Cedric_Smith_(disambiguation)","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Statistician","/wiki/Geneticist","/wiki/Leicester","/wiki/Wyggeston_and_Queen_Elizabeth_I_College","/wiki/Bec_School","/wiki/Tooting","/wiki/University_College_School","/wiki/Higher_School_Certificate_(UK)","/wiki/Exhibition_(scholarship)","/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge","/wiki/Cambridge_Mathematical_Tripos","/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy","#Work_on_combinatorics","#World_War_II","#Post-war_career","#Other_interests","#Family","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Rowland_L._Brooks","/wiki/Arthur_Harold_Stone","/wiki/W._T._Tutte","/wiki/Combinatorics","/wiki/Blanche_Descartes","/wiki/Squared_square","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Quaker","/wiki/Conscientious_objector","/wiki/Addenbrooke%27s_Hospital","/wiki/Peace_and_conflict_studies","/wiki/Society_of_Friends","/wiki/University_of_Bradford","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&veaction=edit&section=3","/wiki/Galton_Laboratory","/wiki/University_College_London","/wiki/Reader_(academic_rank)","/wiki/Biostatistics","/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Royal_Statistical_Society","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&veaction=edit&section=4","/wiki/Anti-Concorde_Project","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&veaction=edit&section=5","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&veaction=edit&section=6","/wiki/BEST_theorem","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&action=edit&section=7","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&veaction=edit&section=7","/wiki/Journal_of_the_Royal_Statistical_Society","#cite_ref-1","http://www.ucl.ac.uk/gee/about/famous-members","#cite_ref-2","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&action=edit&section=8","/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&veaction=edit&section=8","http://www.newton.cam.ac.uk/Abstracts/thompson2.html","http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.3765","http://archives.ucl.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=((RefNo='MS')AND(RefNo='ADD')AND(RefNo='426'))","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Leicester","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Smith_(statistician)&oldid=543987703","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1917_births","/wiki/Category:2002_deaths","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Trinity_College,_Cambridge","/wiki/Category:People_from_Leicester","/wiki/Category:British_conscientious_objectors","/wiki/Category:Biostatisticians","/wiki/Category:English_geneticists","/wiki/Category:English_statisticians","/wiki/Category:British_mathematicians","/wiki/Category:20th-century_mathematicians","/wiki/Category:Academics_of_University_College_London","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_University_College_School","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Wyggeston_Grammar_School_for_Boys","/wiki/Category:British_Quakers","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_October_2010","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Cedric+Smith+%28statistician%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Cedric+Smith+%28statistician%29","/wiki/Cedric_Smith_(
