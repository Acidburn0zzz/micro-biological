What distinguishes the\nblackberry from its raspberry relatives is whether or not the torus (receptacle\nor stem) 'picks-with' (ie stays with) the fruit. When picking a blackberry\nfruit, the torus does stay with the fruit. With a raspberry, the torus remains\non the plant, leaving a hollow core in the raspberry fruit. The term 'bramble',\na word meaning any impenetrable scrub, has traditionally been applied\nspecifically to the blackberry or its products, though in the United\nStates it applies to all members of the Rubus genus. In the western US, the term\ncaneberry is used to refer to blackberries and raspberries as a group rather\nthan the term bramble.\n\nThe usually black fruit is not a true berry. Botanically it is termed an\naggregate fruit, composed of small drupelets. It is a widespread and well-known\ngroup of over 375 species, many of which are closely related apomictic\nmicrospecies native throughout Europe, northwestern Africa, temperate western\nand central Asia and North and South America.
