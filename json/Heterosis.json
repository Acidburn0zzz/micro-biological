The\nadjective derived from heterosis is 'heterotic'.\n\nAn offspring exhibits heterosis if its traits are enhanced (which is often\ndefined in terms of evolutionary fitness) as a result of mixing the genetic\ncontributions of its parents. These effects can be due to Mendelian or non-\nMendelian inheritance.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Heterosis","recorded":1376418414,"links":[],"instances":["genetics","biology","biology","cattle","pig","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical genetics","Breeding"],"headings":["Definitions","Controversy","Genetic and epigenetic bases of heterosis","In plants","Hybrid livestock","Humans","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":[],"tags":[["hybrid","biology"],["trait","biology"],["fitness","biology"],["trait","biology"],["fitness","biology"],["fitness","biology"],["complementation","genetics"],["hereford","cattle"],["hampshire","pig"],["egg","biology"]],"members":["complementation","fitness","trait","hereford","hampshire","hybrid","egg"],"related":["Hybrid_(biology)","Trait_(biology)","Fitness_(biology)","Mendelian_inheritance","Non-Mendelian_inheritance","George_Harrison_Shull","Inbreeding_depression","Genetic_variation","Genetic_drift","Trait_(biology)","Fitness_(biology)","Zygosity","Outcrossing","Outbreeding_depression","Domestic_animal","Crossbred","Genetic_superiority","Fitness_(biology)","Crossbred","Outbreeding_depression","Mule","Animal_husbandry","Natural_selection","Genocide","Dominance_versus_overdominance","Complementation_(genetics)","Heterozygote_advantage","Sickle_cell_trait","Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction","MicroRNA","Histone_H3","Major_histocompatibility_complex","MHC_class_I","MHC_class_II","Antigen_presentation","T-lymphocytes","Antigenic_drift","Maize","Sorghum","Rice","Sugar_beet","Onion","Spinach","Sunflowers","Broccoli","Cannabis","Maize","Developed_country","Fertilizer","George_Harrison_Shull","Edward_Murray_East","William_James_Beal","Michigan_State_University","Charles_Darwin","Field_experiment","Donald_F._Jones","Connecticut","Agricultural_experiment_station","New_Haven","Detasseling","Livestock","Black_Angus","Hereford_(cattle)","Black_Baldy","Swine","Hampshire_(pig)","Beefalo","Poultry","Sex-linked","Egg_(biology)","Unethical","Observational_study","Human_population","Urbanization","Incest_taboo","Miscegenation","F1_hybrid","Heterozygote_advantage","Genetic_admixture","Synergy"]}
