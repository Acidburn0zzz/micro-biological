Recent advances in cellular and developmental biology in\nthe light of evolutionary biology shed light on a number of mechanisms for\ngenerating novelty. While the concept and mechanism of natural selection is well\nunderstood, the variation component of the evolutionary theory remains\nunderdeveloped. Variation mechanisms such as mutations, genetic drift, and\ngenetic flow have been studied and documented thoroughly. The theory of\nfacilitated variation is an effort to illustrate that seemingly complex\nbiological systems can arise with a limited number of genes, and a limited\nnumber of variation mechanisms.\n\nThis is accomplished by exploring the relation between the genotype and\nphenotype, specifically:\n\n* How are changes in the genotype translated to changes in the phenotype?\n* Can environmental conditions affecting the phenotype affect the genotype?\n* Since selection operates on the phenotype, how can physiological adaptability\n  affect selection?\n\nThe theory can be summarized in the following points:\n\n* Organisms have 'constrained' and 'deconstrained' variations of their\n  phenotype. The constrained processes remain mostly unchanged but they allow\n  'deconstrained' processes to alter the phenotype without resulting in\n  lethality.\n* The constrained elements are called \"conserved core processes\" that remain in\n  stasis for perhaps millions of years and they endure little if any changes.\n  These core processes, such as the processing of DNA and RNA, are created in\n  rapid 'invention' periods (e.g. from prokaryotes to Eukaryotes), and are\n  shared by all organisms.\n* The 'deconstrained' processes are those that change the amount, time, kind,\n  and place of gene expression.\n* The 'conserved core processes' are linked via weak regulatory linkage, which\n  is a loose mechanism for signal transcription. This mechanism facilitates new\n  changes in how genes are expressed, thereby leading to variations in the\n  phenotype which are selected upon. Furthermore, changes and combinations of\n  these weak permissive signals can give rise to new novel functions on the\n  structural and molecular level.\n* Exploratory processes have the ability to generate many different phenotypical\n  outcomes or states given a limited number of genes. A few of these states are\n  selected for their physiological adaptability in their respective\n  environmental conditions. For example, the vascular system expands to regions\n  with insufficient oxygen supply. There is no predetermined genetical map for\n  the distribution of blood vessels in the body, but the vascular system\n  responds to signals from hypoxic tissues. Exploratory processes are powerful\n  because they provide organisms with a tremendous adaptation scope.\n\nIn the classical Darwinian view, a large number of successive mutations, each\nselected for its usefulness to the survival of the organism, is required to\nproduce novel structures such as wings, limbs, or the brain. Alternatively,\nfacilitated variation asserts that the physiological adaptability of core\nprocesses and properties such as weak linkage and exploratory processes enable\nproteins, cells, and body structures to interact in numerous ways that can lead\nto the creation of novelty with a limited number of genes, and a limited number\nof mutations.\n\nTherefore, the role of mutations is often to change how, where, and when the\ngenes are expressed during the development of the embryo and adult.\n\nThe theory challenges Irreducible complexity by explaining how mutation can\ncause unusual changes within a species. They explain how the individual organism\ncan change from a passive target of natural selection, to a central player in\nthe 3-billion-year history of evolution. Kirschner and Gerhart's theory also\nprovides a scientific rebuttal to modern critics of evolution who champion\n\"intelligent design\".\n","linknr":114,"url":"Facilitated_variation","recorded":1376422934,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facilitated_variation","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Marc_W._Kirschner","/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School","/w/index.php?title=John_C._Gerhart&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley","#cite_note-Charlesworth2005-1","/wiki/Genetic_variability","/wiki/Evolution","/wiki/Cell_biology","/wiki/Developmental_biology","/wiki/Evolutionary_biology","/wiki/Irreducible_complexity","/wiki/Mutation","/wiki/Intelligent_design","#See_also","#References","#Further_reading","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Orthogenesis","/wiki/Mutationism","/wiki/Evolvability","/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-Charlesworth2005_1-0","http://toriah.org/articles/charlesworth-2005.pdf","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.1119727","/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&veaction=edit&section=3","/wiki/Yale_University_Press","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0300108656","http://www.pnas.org/content/104/suppl.1/8582.long","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.0701035104","/wiki/PubMed_Central","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876433","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17494755","/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&veaction=edit&section=4","http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300108656","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&oldid=544173475","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Evolutionary_biology","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Facilitated+variation&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Facilitated+variation","/wiki/Facilitated_variation","/wiki/Talk:Facilitated_variation","#","/wiki/Facilitated_variation","/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Facilitated_variation","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Facilitated_variation","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&oldid=544173475","/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1238372","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Facilitated_variation&id=544173475","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Facilitated+variation","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Facilitated+variation&oldid=544173475&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Facilitated_variation&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erleichterte_Variation","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1238372#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/
