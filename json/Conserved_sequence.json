{"cursor":"7627","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"s are highlighted in green.]] In biology, 'conserved sequences' are similar or\nidentical sequences that occur within nucleic acid sequences (such as RNA and\nDNA sequences), protein sequences, protein structures or polymeric carbohydrates\nacross species (orthologous sequences) or within different molecules produced by\nthe same organism (paralogous sequences). In the case of cross species\nconservation, this indicates that a particular sequence may have been maintained\nby evolution despite speciation. The further back up the phylogenetic tree a\nparticular conserved sequence may occur the more highly conserved it is said to\nbe. Since sequence information is normally transmitted from parents to progeny\nby genes, a conserved sequence implies that there is a 'conserved gene'.\n\nIt is widely believed that mutation in a \"highly conserved\" region leads to a\nnon-viable life form, or a form that is eliminated through natural selection.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Conserved_sequence","recorded":1376418385,"links":[],"instances":["biochemistry","biology","dna"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bioinformatics","Computational phylogenetics","Nucleic acids","Protein structure","Carbohydrates","Population genetics","Molecular genetics"],"headings":["Conserved nucleic acid sequences","Conserved protein sequences and structures","Conserved polymeric carbohydrate sequences","Biological role of sequence conservation","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":[],"tags":[["sequence","biology"],["homology","biology#orthology"],["homology","biology#paralogy"],["repeated_sequence","dna"],["receptor","biochemistry"]],"members":["receptor","homology","sequence","repeated_sequence"],"related":["Biology","Sequence_(biology)","Nucleic_acid","DNA_sequence","Peptide_sequence","Protein_structure","Polysaccharide","Speciation","Phylogenetic_tree","Gene","Mutation","Natural_selection","Ultra-conserved_element","Repeated_sequence_(DNA)","TATA_box","DNA_sequence","Eukaryote","Amino_acid","Amino_acid","Zinc_finger","GenBank","Clustalw","Sequence_alignment","Proteins","Glycosaminoglycan","Evolutionary","Active_site","Enzyme","Binding_site","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Conserved_non-coding_sequence","Cis-regulatory_element","HCONDELs","Ultra-conserved_element","Sequence_alignment","Sequence_alignment_software","ClustalW","UCbase"]}
