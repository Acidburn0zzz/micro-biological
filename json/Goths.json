{"cursor":"53257","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nGothic|Goth (disambiguation)}}\n\n of the Gothic monarch Theodoric the Great, in Ravenna, Italy.]]\n\nThe 'Goths' (; ; ; ; ) were an East Germanic people, two of whose branches, the\nVisigoths and the Ostrogoths, played an important role in the fall of the Roman\nEmpire and the emergence of Medieval Europe.\n\nAn important source of knowledge of the Goths is [[Getica]], a semi-fictional\naccount, written in the sixth century by the Roman historian Jordanes, of their\nmigration from southern Scandza (Scandinavia), into Gothiscandzaâbelieved to be\nthe lower Vistula region in modern Pomeraniaâand from there to the coast of the\nBlack Sea. Archaeological evidence from the Pomeranian Wielbark culture and the\nChernyakhov culture, northeast of the lower Danube, confirms that some such\nmigration did in fact take place. In the third century, the Goths crossed either\nthe lower Danube or the Black Sea, ravaged the Balkan Peninsula and Anatolia as\nfar as Cyprus, and sacked Athens, Byzantium, and Sparta. By the\nfourth century, the Goths had conquered Dacia, and were divided into at least\ntwo distinct groups separated by the Dniester River, the Thervingi (led by the\nBalti dynasty) and the Greuthungi (led by the Amali dynasty). The Goths\ndominated a vast area, which at its peak under the Kings Ermanaric and Athanaric\nextended all the way from the Danube to the Volga river, and from the Black to\nthe Baltic\nSea.

Although the Huns successfully subdued many of the\nGoths, who joined their ranks, a group of Goths led by Fritigern fled across the\nDanube. They then revolted against the Roman Empire, winning a decisive victory\nat the Battle of Adrianople. By this time the Gothic missionary Wulfila, who\ndevised the Gothic alphabet to translate the Bible, had converted many of the\nGoths from paganism to Arian Christianity. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth\ncenturies the Goths separated into two main branches, the Visigoths, who became\nfederates of the Romans, and the Ostrogoths, who joined the Huns.\n\nAfter the Ostrogoths successfully revolted against the Huns at the Battle of\nNedao in 454, their leader Theodoric the Great settled his people in Italy,\nfounding a kingdom which eventually gained control of the whole peninsula.\nShortly after Theodoric's death in 526, the country was captured by the Eastern\nRoman Empire, in a war that devastated and depopulated the peninsula.\nAfter their able leader Totila was killed at the Battle of Taginae, effective\nOstrogothic resistance ended, and the remaining Goths were assimilated by the\nLombards, another Germanic tribe, who invaded Italy and founded a kingdom in the\nnorthern part of the country in 567 AD.\n\nThe Visigoths under Alaric I sacked Rome in 410, defeated Attila at the Battle\nof the Catalaunian Plains in 451, and founded a kingdom in Aquitaine. The\nVisigoths were pushed to Hispania by the Franks following the Battle of VouillÃ©\nin 507. By the late sixth century, the Visigoths had converted to Catholicism.\nThey were conquered in the early eighth century by the Muslim Moors, but began\nto regain control under the leadership of the Visigothic nobleman Pelagius,\nwhose victory at the Battle of Covadonga began the centuries-long Reconquista.\nThe Visigoths founded the Kingdom of Asturias, which eventually evolved into\nmodern Spain and Portugal.

As late as the sixteenth century a small number of people in the Crimea\nmay still have been speaking the Gothic language known as Crimean\nGothic.
