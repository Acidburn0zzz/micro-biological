{"cursor":"5143","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Clement Lawrence Markert' (April 11, 1917 – October 1, 1999) was an\nAmerican biologist credited with the discovery of isozymes (different forms of\nenzymes that catalyze the same reaction). He was a member of the National\nAcademy of Science and American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and served as\npresident of several biology societies.\n\nMarkert was born in Las Animas, Colorado and raised in Pueblo, Colorado. He\nattended the University of Colorado, and in 1937, left college to fight in the\nSpanish Civil War—stowing away aboard a freighter to circumvent government\ntravel restrictions. After returning to college, Markert completed his\nbachelor's degree in 1940; upon graduation, he married Margaret Rempfer, and\nthey moved to UCLA for graduate work. He enrolled in the United\nStates Merchant Marine to take part in World War II; by 1954 they would have\nthree children.. After the war, he finished a master's degree at UCLA followed\nby a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1948. \"[http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-\nybc/v28.n10/story16.html Pioneering biologist Clement L. Markert dies at age\n82]\", Yale Bulletin and Calendar, Volume 28, Number 10 (October 25-November 1,\n1999). Accessed September 8, 2007\n\nMarkert's Ph.D. research, and subsequent postdoctoral work at Caltech, focused\non the sexuality and other physiological and genetic aspects of [[Glomerella]],\na genus of pathogenic plant fungi. At Caltech, he also worked with George Beadle\non corn and [[Neurospora]] genetics.\n\nIn 1950 he began teaching at the University of Michigan, part of the new wave of\nwhat would become molecular biology. In 1954, Markert became a victim of\nMcCarthyism; he was suspended from teaching because he refused to testify before\nthe House Un-American Activities Committee. He was later reinstated, and\ncontinued at the University of Michigan until moving to Johns Hopkins in 1957,\nfollowed by Yale University—as head of the Department of\nBiology.

[http://www.aibs.org/about-\naibs/past_aibs_presidents.html Past AIBS Presidents], accessed September 8,\n2007 He remained at Yale until retiring in 1986 to North Carolina State\nUniversity, where he continued researching until\n1993. [http://www.sdbonline.org/archive/SDBMembership/markert.html Clement\nL. Markert (1917-1999)], accessed September 8, 2007\n\nEarly in his career, Markert developed the concept of isozymes based on\nelectrophoresis and histochemical staining of enzymes. He found that often what\nhad been assumed to be a single enzyme catalyzing a specific reaction was in\nfact multiple enzymes, with different proteins present in different tissues. In\nbiochemistry, this forced a re-evaluation of some basic assumptions of enzyme\nkinetics; in genetics, it contributed to the shift from the \"one gene-one enzyme\nhypothesis\" to the \"one gene-one polypeptide\" concept. Markert's early work with\nisozymes, many of which are formed by gene duplication, was a precursor to the\nconcept of gene families. Markert's later career focused on developmental\nbiology, particularly developmental genetics in experiments with mosaic\nanimals. D. L. Nanney and G. S. Whitt, \"Clement L. Markert (1917-\n1999): The Academic Odyssey of a Developmental Biologist\", [[Journal of\nHeredity]], vol. 91, no. 3 (2000), pp. 265-267\n\nMarkert was Editor-in-Chief of the [[Journal of Experimental Zoology]] from 1963\nto 1985. Jon W. Gordon, \"In memorial: Clement L. Markert\", [[Journal of\nExperimental Zoology]], vol. 286, no. 6 (2000), p. 551. He also edited the\n[[Journal of Developmental Biology]].\n\nIn 1990, the University of Michigan created the annual \"Davis, Markert,\nNickerson Lecture on Academic and Intellectual Freedom\" series, in honor of\nMarkert and two other Michigan faculty suspended for refusing to testify in\n1954.
