Dictionary of Forestry.] or skeleton cars.\n\nIn forestry, the term logging is sometimes used in a narrow sense concerning the\nlogistics of moving wood from the stump to somewhere outside the forest, usually\na sawmill or a lumber yard. However, in common usage, the term may be used to\nindicate a range of forestry or silviculture activities.\n\nIllegal logging refers to what in forestry might be called timber theft.

The\nharvesting procedure itself may be illegal, including using corrupt means to\ngain access to forests; extraction without permission or from a protected area;\nthe cutting of protected species; or the extraction of timber in excess of\nagreed limits. [http://www.illegal-logging.info/ Illegal Logging.Info]\n\nClearcut logging is not necessarily considered a type of 'logging' but a harvest\nor silviculture method and is simply called clearcutting or block cutting. In\nthe forest products industry logging companies may be referred to as logging\ncontractors, with the smaller, non-union crews referred to as \"gyppo loggers.\"\n\nCutting trees with the highest value and leaving those with lower value, often\ndiseased or malformed trees, is referred to as high grading. It is sometimes\ncalled selective logging, and confused with selection cutting, the practice of\nmanaging stands by harvesting a proportion of trees. [http://www.na.fs.fed.-\nus/stewardship/newsltr/newsletter/04fall_stewardship.pdf Forest Matters: Just\nSay No to High Grading page 8]\n\nLogging usually refers to above-ground forestry logging. Submerged forests exist\non land that has been flooded by damming to create reservoirs. Such trees are\nlogged using underwater logging or by the lowering of the reservoirs in\nquestion. Ootsa Lake and Williston Lake in British Columbia, Canada, are notable\nexamples where timber recovery has been needed to remove inundated\nforests.
