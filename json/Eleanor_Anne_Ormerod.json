She was a daughter of George Ormerod, F.R.S., author of The\nHistory of Cheshire, and was born at Sedbury Park, Gloucestershire. From early\nchildhood insects were her interest and she had great opportunities to study\nthem in the large estate where she grew up. She studied agriculture in general\nand became a local authority on it. When, in 1868, the Royal Horticultural\nSociety began forming a collection of insect pests of the farm for practical\npurposes, Ormerod contributed greatly to it, and was awarded the Flora medal of\nthe society.\n\nIn 1877 she published a pamphlet, Notes for Observations on Injurious Insects,\nwhich was distributed to interested persons, who in turn sent in the results of\ntheir researches, resulting in a series of Annual Series of Reports on Injurious\nInsects and Farm Pests. In 1881 Ormerod published a special report on the turnip-\nfly, and in 1882 was appointed consulting entomologist to the Royal Agricultural\nSociety, a post she held until 1892. For several years she was lecturer on\nscientific entomology at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester.\n\nHer fame was not confined to England; she received silver and gold medals from\nthe University of Moscow for her models of insects injurious to plants, and her\ntreatise on The Injurious Insects of South Africa showed how wide was her range.\nIn 1899 she received a silver medal from the SociÃ©tÃ© nationale d'acclimatation\nde France.\n\nHer works on natural history were widely cited and she undertook brave\nexperiments: {{quote|Miss Ormerod, to personally test the effect, pressed part\nof the back and tail of a live Crested Newt between the teeth. \"The first effect\nwas a bitter astringent feeling in the mouth, with irritation of the upper part\nof the throat, numbing of the teeth more immediately holding the animal, and in\nabout a minute from the first touch of the newt a strong flow of saliva. This\nwas accompanied by much foam and violent spasmodic action, approaching\nconvulsions, but entirely confined to the mouth itself. The experiment was\nimmediately followed by headache lasting for some hours, general discomfort of\nthe system, and half an hour after by slight shivering fits.\"|-Gadow,\n1909 Gadow, Hans 1909. Amphibia and Reptiles. Macmillan and Co.\nLondon. }}\n\nAmong other works are the Cobden Journals, Manual of Injurious Insects, and\nHandbook of Insects injurious to Orchard and Bush Fruits. Almost the last honour\nwhich fell to her was the honorary degree of LL.D. of Edinburgh University - a\nunique distinction, for she was the first woman upon whom the university had\nconferred this degree. The dean of the legal faculty summarised Ormerod's\ncontributions:\n\n\nShe was also the first women to be honored with a fellowship in the\nMeteorological Society (1878).\n\nOn the death of her father she and her sisters moved to Torquay but then\nrelocated to Spring Grove, Isleworth to be near to Kew Gardens where she had\nclose friends in Sir Joseph and Lady Hooker, the garden's director.\n\nIn 1887 she moved to Torrington House, 47 Holywell Hill, St Albans,\nHertfordshire with her sister Georgiana Elizabeth Ormerod. She died there on 19\nJuly 1901. The building bears a plaque in her honour.\n","linknr":151,"url":"Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod","recorded":1376425272,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:EleanorAnneOrmerod.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/EleanorAnneOrmerod.jpg","/wiki/Sedbury","/wiki/Gloucestershire","/wiki/St_Albans","/wiki/Hertfordshire","/wiki/British_people","/wiki/Entomology","/wiki/Agriculture","/wiki/Royal_Agricultural_College","/wiki/English_people","/wiki/Entomology","/wiki/George_Ormerod","/wiki/Sedbury","/wiki/Gloucestershire","/wiki/Insect","/wiki/Agriculture","/wiki/Royal_Horticultural_Society","#cite_note-autobiography-1","/wiki/Delia_radicum","/wiki/Royal_Agricultural_Society_of_England","/wiki/Royal_Agricultural_College","/wiki/Cirencester","#cite_note-autobiography-1","/wiki/File:Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod_(1828-1901).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod_%281828-1901%29.jpg/170px-Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod_%281828-1901%29.jpg","/wiki/File:Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod_(1828-1901).jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/University_of_Moscow","/wiki/Natural_history","/wiki/Hans_Friedrich_Gadow","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Edinburgh_University","/wiki/Demeter","#cite_note-autobiography-1","/wiki/Kew_Gardens","#cite_note-autobiography-1","/wiki/St_Albans","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod&veaction=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-autobiography_1-0","#cite_ref-autobiography_1-1","#cite_ref-autobiography_1-2","#cite_ref-autobiography_1-3","http://www.archive.org/stream/eleanorormerodll00ormerich/eleanorormerodll00ormerich_djvu.txt","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2F064330a0","/wiki/File:Wikisource-logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Ormerod,_Eleanor_A.","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod&veaction=edit&section=3","http://www.sedburypark.co.uk/eleanor_ormerod.htm","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/47006270","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Sedbury","/wiki/Gloucestershire","/wiki/St_Albans","/wiki/Hertfordshire","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod&oldid=568019189","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1828_births","/wiki/Category:1901_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_entomologists","/wiki/Category:Lepidopterists","/wiki/Category:People_from_Forest_of_Dean_(district)","/wiki/Category:Academics_of_the_Royal_Agricultural_University","/wiki/Category:19th-century_women_scientists","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Victorian_era","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_August_2010","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_with_Wikisource_reference","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_the_1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Eleanor+Anne+Ormerod&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Eleanor+Anne+Ormerod","/wiki/Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod","/wiki/Talk:Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod","#","/wiki/Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_Anne_Ormerod&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wm
