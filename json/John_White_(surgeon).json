{"cursor":"4260","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'John White' (c. 1756 â 20 February 1832) was an English surgeon and botanical\ncollector.\n\nWhite was born in Sussex (some sources state he was born in 1750) and entered the Royal Navy on 26 June 1778 as third surgeon's\nmate. He was promoted surgeon in 1780, and was the principal\nsurgeon during the voyage of the First Fleet to Australia. In March 1787 White\njoined the First Fleet transports at Plymouth, where he found that the convicts\nhad been living for some time on salt meat, a bad preparation for a long voyage.\nHe succeeded in obtaining supplies of fresh meat and vegetables for them, and\narranged that they should be allowed up on deck in relays to obtain fresh air.\nHis sensible and humane treatment was probably the reason why the number of\nconvict deaths during the voyage was not higher. John White was a\nsurgeon serving on the ship [[Charlotte (ship)|Charlotte]] during his voyage to\nAustralia.\n\nWhite arrived in Australia in 1788 as Surgeon-General of New South Wales and\norganised a hospital, but was hampered by the lack of medical supplies. He\nbecame interested in the native flora and fauna of the new land and investigated\nthe potential of Australian plants for use as medicine. He observed the\nolifactory qualities of eucalyptus and distilled eucalyptus oil in 1788.\n\nWhite wrote A Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales (1790), which described\nmany Australian species for the first time. Bauer, A. M. (1999) \"Notes on\nJohn White's Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales (1790), a Classic of\nAustralian Herpetology\" [[Bibliotheca Herpetologica|International Society for\nthe History and Bibliography of Herpetology Newsletter and Bulletin]] 1(1):\npp. 16–19 Journal had 65 copper-plate engravings of birds,\nanimals, and botanical specimens, and during the next five years was\ntranslated into German and French. White was the first to\ndescribe the South-East Asian frog Litoria caerulea, which was subsequently\nnamed White's Tree Frog.\n\nAccording to his journal, he severely disliked Australia, describing it as: \"a\ncountry and place so forbidding and so hateful as only to merit execration and\ncurses.\" He applied for leave of absence in 1792, and received it in 1794,\nsailing for England on 17 December 1794 and later travelled to Ireland. In 1796\nhe resigned his position when given the option of returning to Australia. White\nwas a surgeon on the Royal William, and for 20 years he was stationed first at\nSheerness from 1799 and then at Chatham Dockyard from 1803. He retired on a half\npension in 1820. White died in Worthing, England.\n","linknr":135,"url":"John_White_(surgeon)","recorded":1376425390,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_White_(surgeon)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_White_(surgeon)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_White_(surgeon)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/England","/wiki/Surgery","/wiki/Botany","#cite_note-DAB-1","/wiki/Royal_Navy","#cite_note-ADB-2","/wiki/First_Fleet","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Plymouth","#cite_note-DAB-1","/wiki/Charlotte_(ship)","/wiki/New_South_Wales","/wiki/Eucalyptus_oil","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-DAB-1","/wiki/White%27s_Tree_Frog","/wiki/Sheerness","/wiki/Chatham_Dockyard","#cite_note-ADB-2","/wiki/Worthing","/wiki/List_of_botanists_by_author_abbreviation","/wiki/Author_citation_(botany)","/wiki/Botanical_name","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=John_White_(surgeon)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=John_White_(surgeon)&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-DAB_1-0","#cite_ref-DAB_1-1","#cite_ref-DAB_1-2","/wiki/Percival_Serle","http://gutenberg.net.au/dictbiog/0-dict-biogWe-Wy.html#white3","/wiki/Dictionary_of_Australian_Biography","#cite_ref-ADB_2-0","#cite_ref-ADB_2-1","http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020536b.htm","/wiki/Australian_Dictionary_of_Biography","/wiki/Melbourne_University_Press","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Bibliotheca_Herpetologica","#cite_ref-4","http://www.ipni.org/ipni/advAuthorSearch.do?find_abbreviation=J.White","/wiki/International_Plant_Names_Index","/w/index.php?title=John_White_(surgeon)&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=John_White_(surgeon)&veaction=edit&section=2","http://purl.library.usyd.edu.au/setis/id/p00092","/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#text_ignored","http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0301531h.html","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/88083866","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_White_(surgeon)&oldid=567230493","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Botanists_with_author_abbreviations","/wiki/Category:1756_births","/wiki/Category:1832_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_surgeons","/wiki/Category:English_botanists","/wiki/Category:Pages_with_citations_using_unnamed_parameters","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+White+%28surgeon%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+White+%28surgeon%29","/wiki/John_White_(surgeon)","/wiki/Talk:John_White_(surgeon)","#","/wiki/John_White_(surgeon)","/w/index.php?title=John_White_(surgeon)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_White_(surgeon)&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_White_(surgeon)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/John_White_(surgeon)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/John_White_(surgeon)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=John_White_(surgeon)&oldid=567230493","/w/index.php?title=John_White_(surgeon)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1387000","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=John_White_%28surgeon%29&id=567230493","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=John+White+%28surgeon%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=John+White+%28surgeon%29&oldid=567230493&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=John_White_(surgeon)&printable=yes","//ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_White_(cirurgi%C3%A0)","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_White_(Chirurg)","//es
