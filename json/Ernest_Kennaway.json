He first became\ninterested in natural life when, due to a childhood illness, he was encouraged\nto spend time outdoors. He was trained at University\nCollege London, and in 1898 was accepted into New College, Oxford on an open\nscholarship to study natural sciences. He graduated with a BA in 1903, and after\nthree years at Middlesex Hospital he gained a Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery.\nAfter graduating he worked for The Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine and\nUCL before returning to Oxford, this time to Brasenose College on a Hulme\nscholarship in 1909. He became a Travelling Fellow of Brasenose in 1910, a\nDoctor of Medicine in 1911 and a Doctor of Science (specifically physiological\nchemistry) in 1915.\n\nIn 1909 he became a physiology demonstrator at Guy's Hospital, where he remained\nuntil he was made head of the department of chemical pathology at the Bland-\nSutton Institute of Pathology in 1914. As head of department he conducted\nresearch into purine metabolism and ketonuria, proving in 1921 that the\ncarcinogen in coal was a cyclic hydrocarbon. In 1929 he discovered the first\npure compound to show evidence of cancer-causing activity, 1:2:5:6-\ndibenzanthracene, and also discovered a series of other carcinogenic\nhydrocarbons including methylcholanthrene. Between 1932 and\n1942 he published six articles on these discoveries in the Proceedings of the\nRoyal Society.\n\nAfter the death of Professor Archibald Leitch in 1931 Kenneway became professor\nof chemical pathology at the University of London, where he remained until his\nretirement in 1946. He was awarded the Royal Medal in 1941\n\"For his discovery of the nature of the carcinogenic substances in coal tar and\nfor his investigations on production of cancer by synthetic\nsubstances.\" and was knighted in 1947. For over thirty years he had\nsuffered from Parkinson's disease, and this eventually killed him on 1 January\n1958.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Ernest_Kennaway","recorded":1376425088,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ernest_Kennaway&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ernest_Kennaway&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Kennaway","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Exeter","/wiki/St._Bartholomews_Hospital","/wiki/London_EC1","/wiki/England","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Pathology","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/University_College_London","/wiki/University_of_Oxford","/wiki/Royal_Medal","/wiki/Royal_Medal","#cite_note-odnb-1","/wiki/University_College_London","/wiki/New_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Middlesex_Hospital","/wiki/Bachelor_of_Medicine_and_Surgery","/wiki/The_Lister_Institute_for_Preventive_Medicine","/wiki/Brasenose_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine","/wiki/Doctor_of_Science","#cite_note-odnb-1","/wiki/Guy%27s_Hospital","/wiki/Purine_metabolism","/wiki/Ketonuria","/wiki/Cyclic_hydrocarbon","/wiki/Methylcholanthrene","#cite_note-odnb-1","/wiki/University_of_London","#cite_note-odnb-1","/wiki/Royal_Medal","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease","#cite_note-odnb-1","/w/index.php?title=Ernest_Kennaway&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Ernest_Kennaway&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-odnb_1-0","#cite_ref-odnb_1-1","#cite_ref-odnb_1-2","#cite_ref-odnb_1-3","#cite_ref-odnb_1-4","http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34277?docPos=1","#cite_ref-2","http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1752","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/84829828","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Exeter","/wiki/St._Bartholomews_Hospital","/wiki/London_EC1","/wiki/England","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ernest_Kennaway&oldid=560928330","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1881_births","/wiki/Category:1958_deaths","/wiki/Category:British_biochemists","/wiki/Category:British_pathologists","/wiki/Category:Royal_Medal_winners","/wiki/Category:Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_New_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_University_College_London","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ernest+Kennaway&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ernest+Kennaway","/wiki/Ernest_Kennaway","/wiki/Talk:Ernest_Kennaway","#","/wiki/Ernest_Kennaway","/w/index.php?title=Ernest_Kennaway&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ernest_Kennaway&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ernest_Kennaway&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Ernest_Kennaway","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Ernest_Kennaway","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Ernest_Kennaway&oldid=560928330","/w/index.php?title=Ernest_Kennaway&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5393384","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Ernest_Kennaway&id=560928330","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Ernest+Kennaway","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Ernest+Kennaway&oldid=560928330&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Ernest_Kennaway&printable=yes","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8D%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B1%E3%83%8A%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A4","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Kennaway","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5393384#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//cr
