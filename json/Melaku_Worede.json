{"cursor":"3968","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Melaku Worede' was born in Ethiopia in 1936. After obtaining a PhD in Agronomy\n(Genetics and Breeding) from the University of Nebraska, he returned to Ethiopia\nand became involved in the planning of the Plant Genetic Resources Centre in\nAddis Ababa, of which he became Director in 1979. He held this post until his\nretirement in 1993 to join the Seeds of Survival Programme of Ethiopia, which he\nfounded with the support of a consortium of Canadian NGOs led by the Unitarian\nService Committee (USC/Canada).\n\nMelaku Worede was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1989.\n\nEthiopia is one of the world's eight 'Vavilov Centres' noted for their great\ngenetic diversity. It is this bio-diversity - now under great threat from\ndrought and modern farming methods - that Worede has sought to preserve.\nFurther, the Plant Genetic Resources Centre (PGRC) set out to establish\n'Strategic Seed Reserves' of traditional varieties that could be released to\nfarmers for planting in times of drought when no other seeds were likely to\nthrive. In only a few years, Worede and his staff collected and safely stored a\nconsiderable amount of Ethiopia's genetic wealth. In the process, he established\nnot only Africa's finest facility of its kind, but also one of the world's\npremier genetic conservation systems. Worede built this institution exclusively\nwith Ethiopian staff, training a whole new generation of plant breeders and\ngeneticists in his home country. Worede retired from government service to\ncontinue and develop his pioneer work on a farming-based native seed (landrace)\nconservation, enhancement and utilisation. Growing without commercial\nfertilisers or other chemicals, the locally adapted native seeds developed in\nthis way (e.g. durum wheat) have been shown to exceed their high-input\ncounterparts on the average by 10-15% and the original farmers' cultivars by 20-\n25% in yield.\n\nWorede has been active in the training of several gene bank curators and many\nother young scientists. Several initiatives to support biodiversity conservation\nand utilisation in Africa take the Ethiopian experience as their model, and are\nthus attributable to Worede's ground-breaking work.\n\nAlso very active at the international level, Worede was the first Chair of the\nAfrican Committee for Plant and Genetic Resources, and has been instrumental\nin the setting up of the African Biodiversity Network. He has served as Chair\nof the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's Commission on Plant Genetic\nResources, and is currently a Board member of (among others) the International\nPlant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) and the Rural Advancement Foundation\nInternational (RAFI). In 2008 the National Green Award Foundation, headed by\nthe Ethiopian president, gave Worede the Outstanding International\nContribution Award.\n\nDr Melaku features in the film [http://www.seedsoffreedom.info Seeds of Freedom]\nwhich was released in June 2012, and features narration from Oscar Winning Actor\nJeremy Irons. The film was produced by The Gaia Foundation and the African\nBiodiversity Network, both organisations with whom Dr Melaku has been a long\nterm ally and worked alongside to lead a number of trainings with Field Officers\nworking across Africa.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Melaku_Worede","recorded":1376425976,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Melaku_Worede&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Melaku_Worede&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melaku_Worede","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Ethiopia","/wiki/Agronomy","/wiki/University_of_Nebraska","/wiki/Addis_Ababa","/wiki/Seeds_of_Survival","/wiki/Right_Livelihood_Award","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Durum_wheat","http://www.seedsoffreedom.info","/wiki/Jeremy_Irons","/w/index.php?title=Melaku_Worede&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Melaku_Worede&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.rightlivelihood.org/worede.html","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Ethiopia.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Flag_of_Ethiopia.svg/30px-Flag_of_Ethiopia.svg.png","/wiki/File:Crystal_Clear_app_Login_Manager_2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c2/Crystal_Clear_app_Login_Manager_2.png/30px-Crystal_Clear_app_Login_Manager_2.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Melaku_Worede&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Ethiopia-bio-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Ethiopia-bio-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Ethiopia-bio-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Melaku_Worede&oldid=555514950","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1936_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Ethiopian_scientists","/wiki/Category:Agronomists","/wiki/Category:University_of_Nebraska_alumni","/wiki/Category:Right_Livelihood_Award_laureates","/wiki/Category:Ethiopian_people_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Melaku+Worede&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Melaku+Worede","/wiki/Melaku_Worede","/wiki/Talk:Melaku_Worede","#","/wiki/Melaku_Worede","/w/index.php?title=Melaku_Worede&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Melaku_Worede&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Melaku_Worede&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Melaku_Worede","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Melaku_Worede","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Melaku_Worede&oldid=555514950","/w/index.php?title=Melaku_Worede&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6810976","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Melaku_Worede&id=555514950","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Melaku+Worede","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Melaku+Worede&oldid=555514950&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Melaku_Worede&printable=yes","//am.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%88%98%E1%88%8B%E1%8A%A9_%E1%8B%88%E1%88%A8%E1%8B%B0","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6810976#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melaku_Worede","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&
