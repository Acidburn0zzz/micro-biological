At birth, a baby llama (called a cria) can\nweigh between 9 and 14 kg (20 and 30 lb). Llamas can live for about\n20â30 years with good care. They are very social animals and live with other\nllamas as a herd. The wool produced by a llama is very soft and lanolin-free.\nLlamas are intelligent and can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions. When\nusing a pack, they can carry about 25% to 30% of their body weight for 8â13 km\n(5â8 miles). {{cite web\n|url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/other/llama/ |publisher=Oklahoma State\nUniversity |title=Llama |date=2007-06-25}}\n\nThe name llama (in the past also spelled 'lama' or 'glama') was adopted by\nEuropean settlers from native Peruvians. Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd\nedition, \"llama\"\n\nLlamas appear to have originated from the central plains of North America about\n40 million years ago. They migrated to South America about three million years\nago. By the end of the last ice age (10,000â12,000 years ago), camelids were\nextinct in North America. As of 2007, there were over\nseven million llamas and alpacas in South America, and due to importation from\nSouth America in the late 20th century, there are now over 158,000 llamas and\n100,000 alpacas in the United States and Canada. {{cite web\n|url=http://www.scla.us/llamafacts.html |author=South Central Llama Association\n|title=Llama Facts |date=2009-01-22}}\n","linknr":-1,"url":"llama","recorded":1376418429,"links":[],"instances":["culture","animal","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Camelids","Animal hair products","Livestock","Mammals of South America","Megafauna","Animals described in 1758"],"headings":["Classification","Characteristics","Reproduction","Nutrition","Behavior","History","Fiber","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["hybrid","biology"],["moche","culture"],["moche","culture"],["cama","animal"]],"members":["moche","cama","hybrid"],"related":["Animal","Chordate","Mammal","Artiodactyla","Camelidae","Carl_Linnaeus","10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae","South_America","Camelid","List_of_meat_animals","Pack_animal","Inca_empire","Pre-Hispanic","Cria","Herd","Lanolin","Backpack","Kilometre","Mile","Oklahoma_State_University","European_colonization_of_the_Americas","Indigenous_peoples_in_Peru","North_America","Year","Quaternary_glaciation","Alpaca","United_States","Canada","Cuzco","Peru","Vicuña","Guanaco","Alpaca","Alpaca","Carolus_Linnaeus","Georges_Cuvier","Guanaco","Alpaca","Vicuña","Artiodactyla","Tylopoda","Taxon","Suinae","Pig","Chevrotain","Pecora","Ruminant","Cetancodonta","Hippopotamidae","Cetacea","Cladistics","Taxon","Paleogene","Joseph_Leidy","Edward_Drinker_Cope","Othniel_Charles_Marsh","South_America","Pleistocene","Rocky_Mountains","Central_America","Fossil","California","Texas","New_Mexico","Utah","Missouri","Florida","Miocene","Old_World","Camels","Beringia","Isthmus_of_Panama","Great_American_Interchange","Quaternary_extinction_event","Dentition","Incisor","Premaxilla","Canine_tooth","Premolar","Molars","Cranial_ridges","Vertebrae","Natural_history","Carl_Linnaeus","Alpaca","Guanaco","Quechua_languages","Philipp_Ludwig_Statius_Müller","Vicuña","Juan_Ignacio_Molina","Herd","Peru","Ecuador","Bolivia","Chamois","Alps","Hybrid_(biology)","Camel","Colorado_State_University","Fort_Collins","Cria","Alpaca","Vicuña","Guanaco","University_of_Illinois","Chile","Progesterone","North_Dakota_State_University","Iowa_State_University","Weaning","Berserk_llama_syndrome","United_States","Lambing","Moche_(culture)","Larco_Museum","Thames_&_Hudson","Moche_(culture)","Pre-Columbian","Peru","Fibre","Meat","Inca","Urcuchillay","Hunter-gatherer","Agriculture","Feces","Fertilizer","Spanish_conquest_of_the_Inca_Empire","Transport","Potosí","Horse","Mule","Donkey","Juan_Ignacio_Molina","Joris_van_Spilbergen","Chilihueques","Mapuche","Mocha_Island","Plough","Micrometre","Vicuña","Alpaca_fiber","Muskox","Merino","Angora_wool","Cashmere_wool","Yak","Camel","Guanaco","Chinchilla","Mohair","Alpaca_fiber","Alpaca","Cama_(animal)","Camel","Grass_Mud_Horse","Guard_llama","Lamoid","Llama_hiking"]}
