AD 250â336), a\nChristian presbyter in Alexandria, Egypt, concerning the relationship of God to\nthe Son of God (Jesus of Nazareth). Arius asserted that the Son of God was a\nsubordinate entity to God the Father. Deemed a heretic by the Ecumenical First\nCouncil of Nicaea of 325, Arius was later exonerated in 335 at the regional\nFirst Synod of Tyre, Socrates of Constantinople, Church History, book 1,\nchapter 33. Anthony F. Beavers, Chronology of the Arian Controversy. and\nthen, after his death, pronounced a heretic again at the Ecumenical First\nCouncil of Constantinople of 381. The Roman Emperors Constantius II\n(337â361) and Valens (364â378) were Arians or Semi-Arians.\n\nThe Arian concept of Christ is that the Son of God did not always exist, but was\ncreated byâand is therefore distinct fromâGod the Father. This belief is\ngrounded in the Gospel of John passage âYou heard me say, âI am going away and I\nam coming back to you.â If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to\nthe Father, for the Father is greater than I.\" ()\n\nArianism is defined as those teachings attributed to Arius which are in\nopposition to the traditional Trinitarian Christological doctrine, as determined\nby the first two Ecumenical Councils and currently maintained by the Roman\nCatholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Churches, the Oriental Orthodox Churches,\nthe Assyrian Church of the East, all Reformation-founded Protestant churches\n(Lutheran, Reformed/Presbyterian, and Anglican), and a large majority of groups\nfounded after the Reformation and calling themselves Protestant (such as\nMethodist, Baptist, most Pentecostals), with the exception of such groups as\nOneness Pentecostals, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jehovah's\nWitnesses, Iglesia ni Cristo and Branhamism. The latter three of which\nconsider themselves not Protestants, but primitive Christians or Christian\nRestorationists, which is disputed by most traditions of mainstream historic\nChristianity; Latter-day Saints believe they are within the fold of historic\nChristianity, but mainstream historic Christianity contests this identification.\nThe identification of Jehovah's Witness theology, which tracks much closer to\nwhat in this article is called \"Arianism\", is more difficult, although generally\nfollowing the same lines as the LDS vis-a-vis mainstream, historic, Niceno-\nConstantinopolitan Chalcedonian Christianity, irrespective of the theological\ndifferences between the LDS church and the Watchtower. For the historic\nChristian view of the LDS, see the Old Catholic Encyclopedia, \"Mormons\", at\n[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10570c.htm Old Catholic Encyclopedia,\n\"Mormons\"] , and Is Mormonism Christian?, Gordon H Fraser, Moody Press 1977 (not\navailable online). For the LDS view of historic Christianity, see both [https://www.lds.org/ensign/1987/07/is-the-lds-view-of-god-consistent-with-the-\nbible?lang=eng Is the LDS view of God Consistent with the Bible?

New Era, May 1998] \"Arianism\" is also often used to\nrefer to other nontrinitarian theological systems of the 4th century, which\nregarded Jesus Christâthe Son of God, the Logosâas either a created being (as in\nArianism proper and Anomoeanism), or as neither uncreated nor created in the\nsense other beings are created (as in Semi-Arianism).\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Arianism","recorded":1376429133,"links":[],"instances":["emperor","unitarian","historian","378","mormonism","philosophy","christianity","emperor","christianity"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Arianism","Perspectives
