{"cursor":"22624","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n:For a list of immunosuppressive drugs, see the [[transplant rejection]] page.\n\n'Immunosuppressive drugs' or 'immunosuppressive agents' are drugs that inhibit\nor prevent activity of the immune system. They are used in immunosuppressive\ntherapy to:\n* Prevent the rejection of transplanted organs and tissues (e.g., bone marrow,\n  heart, kidney, liver)\n* Treat autoimmune diseases or diseases that are most likely of autoimmune\n  origin (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis,\n  systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,\n  Crohn's disease, Behcet's Disease, pemphigus, and ulcerative colitis).\n* Treat some other non-autoimmune inflammatory diseases (e.g., long term\n  allergic asthma control).\n\nA common side-effect of many immunosuppressive drugs is immunodeficiency,\nbecause the majority of them act non-selectively, resulting in increased\nsusceptibility to infections and decreased cancer immunosurveillance. There are\nalso other side-effects, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia,\npeptic ulcers, lipodystrophy, moon face, liver and kidney injury. The\nimmunosuppressive drugs also interact with other medicines and affect their\nmetabolism and action. Actual or suspected immunosuppressive agents can be\nevaluated in terms of their effects on lymphocyte subpopulations in tissues\nusing immunohistochemistry.\n\nImmunosuppressive drugs can be classified into five groups:\n* glucocorticoids\n* cytostatics\n* antibodies\n* drugs acting on immunophilins\n* other drugs.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"immunosuppressive_drug","recorded":1376427651,"links":[],"instances":["proteomics","medicine","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immunosuppressants|"],"headings":["Glucocorticoids","Cytostatics","Antibodies","Drugs acting on immunophilins","Other drugs","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["adverse_effect","medicine"],["substrate","biochemistry"],["receptor","proteomics"]],"members":["receptor","adverse_effect","substrate"],"related":["Medication","Immune_system","Immunosuppression","Transplant_rejection","Organ_transplant","Bone_marrow","Heart","Kidney","Liver","Autoimmunity","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Multiple_sclerosis","Myasthenia_gravis","Systemic_lupus_erythematosus","Sarcoidosis","Focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis","Crohn's_disease","Behcet's_Disease","Pemphigus","Ulcerative_colitis","Asthma","Adverse_effect_(medicine)","Immunodeficiency","Infection","Cancer_immunosurveillance","Arterial_hypertension","Dyslipidemia","Hyperglycemia","Peptic_ulcer","Lipodystrophy","Moon_face","Hepatotoxicity","Nephrotoxicity","Metabolism","Lymphocyte","Immunohistochemistry","Allergy","Inflammation","Transplant_rejection","Graft-versus-host_disease","Tissue_reparation","Cell-mediated_immunity","Interleukin_1","Interleukin_2","Interleukin_3","Interleukin_4","Interleukin_5","Interleukin_6","Interleukin_8","Cytokine","T_cell","Humoral_immunity","B_cell","IL-2_receptor","Antibody","Lipocortin-1","Cell_membrane","Phospholipase_A2","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Arachidonic_acid","Eicosanoid","Cyclooxygenase","Leukocyte","Epithelium","Cell_adhesion","Emigration","Chemotaxis","Phagocytosis","Respiratory_burst","Tissue_plasminogen_activator","Chemokine","Neutrophil","Macrophage","Mastocyte","Cytostatic","Cell_division","Purine","Alkylating_antineoplastic_agent","Mustard_gas","Cyclophosphamide","Nitrosourea","Platinum","Systemic_lupus_erythematosus","Hemolytic_anemia","Wegener's_granulomatosis","Pancytopenia","Cystitis","Antimetabolite","Folic_acid","Methotrexate","Purine","Azathioprine","Mercaptopurine","Pyrimidine","Fluorouracil","Protein_biosynthesis","Methotrexate","Folic_acid","Dihydrofolate_reductase","Tetrahydrofolate","Azathioprine","Mercaptopurine","Lymphocyte","Cell_immunity","Humoral_immunity","Dactinomycin","Kidney_transplantation","Anthracycline","Mitomycin_C","Bleomycin","Mithramycin","Antibody","Polyclonal_antibodies","Blood_plasma","Rabbit","Horse","Thymocyte","Antigen","Aplastic_anemia","Lysis","Complement_system","Opsonization","Reticuloendothelial_cell","Circulatory_system","Spleen","Liver","Delayed_hypersensitivity","Tuberculin_skin_reaction","Graft-versus-host_disease","Thymus-dependent","Atgam","Thymoglobuline","Post-transplant_lymphoproliferative_disorder","Cytomegalovirus","Serum_sickness","Immunogenicity","Fever","Rigor","Anaphylaxis","Immune_complex_glomerulonephritis","Joint_pain","Erythema","Analgesic","Urticaria","Serum_fraction","Monoclonal_antibodies","IL-2_receptor","Muromonab-CD3","T-cell","Myalgia","Arthralgia","Conformational_change","Epithelial_reticular_cell","Co-stimulation","Th1_cell","Th2_cell","Neutralizing_antibody","Opportunistic_infection","Interleukin-2","IL-2_receptor","Recombinant_DNA","Basiliximab","Daclizumab","Kidney_transplantation","Tacrolimus","Calcineurin","Cyclophilin","Immunophilin","T-lymphocytes","Interleukin-2","Lymphokine","Interleukin","Nephrotoxic","Skin_cancer","Regulatory_T_cell","Mycophenolate","Macrolide_lactone","Calcineurin","FKBP1A","Calcineurin","Phosphatase","Cell_cycle","Actinomycete","MTOR","Tumor","Multiple_sclerosis","Apoptosis","Opioid","TNF-α","Receptor_(proteomics)","Infliximab","Etanercept","Adalimumab","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Ankylosing_spondylitis","Crohn's_disease","Psoriasis","Curcumin","Turmeric","Green_tea","Tuberculosis","Mycophenolic_acid","Inosine-5′-monophosphate_dehydrogenase","Guanosine","Fingolimod","Integrin","Lymphatic_system","Myriocin","Ciclosporin","Immunosuppression","Immunosuppressant","BK_virus","Behcet's_Disease","Discovery_and_development_of_mTOR_inhibitors","Journal_of_the_American_Society_of_Nephrology","About.com"]}
