Subsequently, it was realized that using vectored thrust in\ncombat situations enabled aircraft to perform various maneuvers not available\nto conventional-engined planes. To perform turns, aircraft that use no thrust\nvectoring must rely on aerodynamic control surfaces only, such as ailerons or\nelevator; craft with vectoring must still use control surfaces, but to a\nlesser extent.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"vectored_thrust","recorded":1376429360,"links":[],"instances":["aircraft"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Jet engines","Airship technology"],"headings":["Thrust vectoring methods","Operational examples","List of vectored thrust aircraft","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["elevator","aircraft"],["uss_akron","zrs-4"],["uss_macon","zrs-5"]],"members":["uss_macon","uss_akron","elevator"],"related":["Sukhoi_Su-35S","X-31","F-16_VISTA","Aircraft","Rocket","Thrust","Engine","Flight_control","Attitude_dynamics_and_control","Angular_velocity","Rocket","Ballistic_missile","Flight_control_surfaces","Attitude_control","VTOL","STOL","Aileron","Elevator_(aircraft)","Flight_path","Line_of_action","Rocket_nozzle","Center_of_mass","Torque","Fins","Liquid_rocket","Gimbal","Rocket_engine","Combustion_chamber","Titan_II","Fuel_pump","Oxidizer","Saturn_V","Space_Shuttle","Solid_rocket_propellant","Ballistic_missile","Liquid_injection","Rocket_nozzle","SLBM","United_States_Navy","Solid_rocket_propellant","Ballistic_missile","Rocket_nozzle","Servomechanism","Hydraulic_cylinder","Ball_joint","Flexible_seal","Torque","UGM-96_Trident_I","UGM-133_Trident_II","Missile","Flight_control_surfaces","Turbofan","Nozzle","Afterburning","Bristol_Siddeley","Bristol_Siddeley_BS100","Tiltrotor","Turboprop","Nacelle","Driveshaft","Vortex_ring","Airship","No._9r","USS_Akron_(ZRS-4)","USS_Macon_(ZRS-5)","Airborne_aircraft_carrier","Non-rigid_airship","Buoyancy","WALRUS_HULA","Enrico_Forlanini","Fluidics","Inertia","Radar_cross_section","Stealth_technology","Unmanned_aerial_vehicle","Fighter_aircraft","Rolls-Royce_Pegasus","Hawker_Siddeley_Harrier","AV-8B_Harrier_II","Lockheed_Martin","F-22_Raptor","Pratt_&_Whitney_F119","Turbofan","F-35_Lightning_II","US_Marine_Corps","UK_Royal_Air_Force","Royal_Navy","Sukhoi_Su-30_MKI","Hindustan_Aeronautics_Limited","Indian_Air_Force","Su-30MKI","Al-31FP","Afterburning","Turbofan","Corkscrew","Space_Shuttle_Solid_Rocket_Booster","SA-10_Grumble","Surface-to-air_missile","UGM-27_Polaris","Nuclear_weapon","Ballistic_missile","SS-24","Swingfire","Hamina_class_missile_boat","VTOL","Armstrong_Whitworth_AW.681","Bell_X-14","V-22_Osprey","Boeing_X-32","MBI","Dornier_Do_31","EWR_VJ_101","Harrier_Jump_Jet","Hawker_Siddeley_Harrier","BAE_Sea_Harrier","AV-8_Harrier_II","BAE_Harrier_II","F-35_Lightning_II","VFW_VAK_191B","Yakovlev_Yak-38","Yakovlev_Yak-141","F-16_VISTA","F-15_STOL/MTD","Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor","McDonnell_Douglas_X-36","Me_163","Sukhoi_Su-30","Sukhoi_Su-35","Sukhoi_Su-37","Sukhoi_PAK_FA","Mikoyan_MiG-35","F-15_STOL/MTD","F-16_VISTA","X-31","F-18_HARV","ATD-X","23_class_airship","Airship_Industries_Skyship_600","Zeppelin_NT","Vectoring_nozzles","Gimbaled_thrust","Reverse_thrust"]}
