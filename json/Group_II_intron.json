{"cursor":"5891","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Group II introns' are a large class of self-catalytic ribozymes as well as\nmobile genetic element found within the genes of all three domains of life.\nRibozyme activity (e.g., Self-splicing) can occur under high-salt conditions in\nvitro. However, assistance from proteins is required for in vivo splicing. In\ncontrast to group I introns, intron excision occurs in the absence of GTP and\ninvolves the formation of a lariat, with an A-residue branchpoint strongly\nresembling that found in lariats formed during splicing of nuclear pre-mRNA. It\nis hypothesized that pre-mRNA splicing (see spliceosome) may have evolved from\ngroup II introns due to the similar catalytic mechanism as well the structural\nsimilarity of the Domain V substructure to the U6/U2 extended snRNA. Finally,\ntheir ability to site-specifically mobilize to new DNA sites has been exploited\nas a tool for biotechnology.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Group_II_intron","recorded":1376418385,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["RNA","Ribozymes","RNA splicing"],"headings":["Structure and catalytic site","Group II catalytic intron","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["splicing","genetics#spliceosomal"]],"members":["splicing"],"related":["Ribozymes","RNA_splicing","Guanosine_triphosphate","Spliceosome","Nucleotide","RNA_Tertiary_Structure","RRNA","TRNA","MRNA","Organelle","Fungi","Plants","Protists","Bacteria","Ribozymes","Structural_domain","Intron","Open_reading_frame","Adenosine","Nucleophilic_attack","Exon","Adenosine","Intron","Splice_site","Group_I_catalytic_intron","Group_III_intron","Twintron"]}
