The term \"domestic dog\" is\ngenerally used for both domesticated and feral varieties. The dog was the first\ndomesticated animal and has been the most widely kept\nworking, hunting, and pet animal in human history. The word \"dog\" can also refer\nto the male of a canine species, as opposed to the word \"bitch\" which\nrefers to the female of the species.\n\nMtDNA evidence shows an evolutionary split between the modern dog's lineage and\nthe modern wolf's lineage around 100,000 years ago but, , the oldest fossil\nspecimens genetically linked to the modern dog's lineage date to approximately\n33,000â36,000 years ago. [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0057754\nDruzhkova AS, Thalmann O, Trifonov VA, Leonard JA, Vorobieva NV, et al. (2013)\nAncient DNA Analysis Affirms the Canid from Altai as a Primitive Dog. PLoS ONE\n8(3): e57754. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0057754] Dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly\nbecoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people,\nsuch as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and\nmilitary, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals.\nThis impact on human society has given them the nickname \"man's best friend\" in\nthe Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are also a source of\nmeat. In 2001, there were estimated to be 400 million\ndogs in the world.\n\nMost breeds of dogs are at most a few hundred years old, having been\nartificially selected for particular morphologies and behaviors by people for\nspecific functional roles. Through this selective breeding, the dog has\ndeveloped into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and\nmorphological variation than any other land mammal. For\nexample, height measured to the withers ranges from in the Chihuahua to about in\nthe Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called\n\"blue\") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark (\"red\" or \"chocolate\") in\na wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-\nlike, straight, curly, or smooth. It is\ncommon for most breeds to shed this coat.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"domestic_dog","recorded":1376418439,"links":[],"instances":["animal","dog","canine","association_football","biology","dog","miniature","dog","dog_yoga","dog","dog","phrase","biology","dog","etymology","dog","ethology","dog","ttc","animal_behavior","zodiac","dog","dog","animal","border_collie"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dogs|","Cosmopolitan
