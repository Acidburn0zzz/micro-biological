{"cursor":"11297","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{multiple issues|\n\n\n\n\n\n}} In cardiovascular physiology, 'ejection fraction' ('EF') represents the\nvolumetric fraction of blood pumped out of the ventricle (heart) with each heart\nbeat or cardiac cycle. It can be applied to either the right ventricle which\nejects via the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary circulation or the left\nventricle which ejects via the aortic valve into the systemic circulation.\n\nImaging of the physiology of the mammalian heart is the art that allows\nmeaningful mathematical expression defining EF. Noninvasive cardiac imaging has\nbecome a worldwide utility enabling study of cardiac performance reproducibly\nand inexpensively. Simplified, Ejection fraction is a mathematical product\nallowed by cardiac imaging. As a mathematical term, Ejection Fraction is an\nextension of the work of Adolph Fick in cardiac output. Dedicated technology\nsuch as Echocardiography, Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and\nMUGA scanning have definitively allowed clinically relevant mathematics\nregarding Ischemia, Congenital Heart Disease and Heart Failure.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Ejection_fraction","recorded":1376428669,"links":[],"instances":["test","medicine","heart"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cardiovascular physiology"],"headings":["Overview","Normal values","Measurement","Improving EF","Treating Low EF","Medication Intervention","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["ventricle","heart"],["systole","medicine"],["gold_standard","test"]],"members":["gold_standard","systole","ventricle"],"related":["Circulatory_system","Blood","Ventricle_(heart)","Cardiac_cycle","Right_ventricle","Pulmonary_valve","Pulmonary_circulation","Left_ventricle","Aortic_valve","Systemic_circulation","Adolph_Fick","Cardiac_output","Echocardiography","Computed_Tomography","Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging","MUGA","Ischemia","Congenital_Heart_Disease","Heart_Failure","End-diastolic_volume","End-systolic_volume","Ratio","Stroke_Volume","Myocardium","Myocardial_infarction","Atrial_fibrillation","Cardiomyopathy","Heart_failure","Social_Security_Administration","Changevolume_/changepressure","Contractility","Prognosis","QT_interval","Electrocardiogram","Echocardiography","Cardiac_cycle","Dimension","Systole_(medicine)","Diastole","Time","Cardiac_output","Cardiac_input","MRI","Computed_axial_tomography","Cardiac_ventriculography","Gated_SPECT","MUGA_scan","Radioisotope","Gold_standard_(test)","Ventriculography","Cardiac_output","Heart_failure","QT_interval"]}
