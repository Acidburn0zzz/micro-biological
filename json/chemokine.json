Their name is derived from their ability\nto induce directed chemotaxis in nearby responsive cells; they are 'chemo'tactic\ncyto'kines'. Proteins are classified as chemokines according to shared\nstructural characteristics such as small size (they are all approximately 8-10\nkilodaltons in size), and the presence of four cysteine residues in conserved\nlocations that are key to forming their 3-dimensional shape. However, these\nproteins have historically been known under several other names including the\nSIS family of cytokines, SIG family of cytokines, SCY family of cytokines,\nPlatelet factor-4 superfamily or intercrines. Some chemokines are considered pro-\ninflammatory and can be induced during an immune response to recruit cells of\nthe immune system to a site of infection, while others are considered\nhomeostatic and are involved in controlling the migration of cells during normal\nprocesses of tissue maintenance or development. Chemokines are found in all\nvertebrates, some viruses and some bacteria, but none have been described for\nother invertebrates.\n\nChemokines have been classified into four main subfamilies : CXC, CC, CX3C and\nXC. All of these proteins exert their biological effects by interacting with G\nprotein-linked transmembrane receptors called chemokine receptors, that are\nselectively found on the surfaces of their target cells.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"chemokine","recorded":1376427546,"links":[],"instances":["biochemistry","gene","hematopoietic","biochemistry","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cytokines","Signal transduction"],"headings":["Function","Types by function","Homing","Types by cell attracted","Structural characteristics","Types by structure","Receptors","Infection control","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["homing","hematopoietic"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["ccr3","gene"],["ccr3","gene"],["ccr3","gene"],["ccr3","gene"],["ccr3","gene"],["ccr3","gene"],["ccr3","gene"],["ligand","biochemistry"],["phosphatidylinositol","4,5-bisphosphate"]],"members":["receptor","ccr3","homing","ligand","cell","phosphatidylinositol"],"related":["Interleukin-8","Cytokine","Cell_signaling","Protein","Cell_(biology)","Chemotaxis","Kilodalton","Cysteine","Inflammation","Immune_system","Infection","Homeostatic","Developmental_biology","Vertebrate","Virus","Bacteria","Invertebrate","G_protein","Transmembrane_receptor","Chemokine_receptor","Immune_system","Lymphocyte","Lymph_node","Antigen-presenting_cell","Homeostatic","Angiogenesis","Blood_vessel","Inflammation","Bacteria","Virus","Silica","Uric_acid","Gout","Interleukin_1","Leukocyte","Monocyte","Neutrophil","Blood","Infection","Wound_healing","Innate_immune_system","Adaptive_immune_system","Leukocyte","Interleukin_1","TNF-alpha","Lipopolysaccharide","Virus","Inflammation","CCL5","Leukocytes","Homing_(hematopoietic)","Homeostatic","Thymus","Lymph_nodes","Ligand","Antigen-presenting_cells","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Leukocytes","Intestine","Skin","B-cell","Lymph_nodes","Bone_marrow","Inflammation","Infection","CCL5","CXCL8","T_lymphocytes","Ligand","Mast_cell","Lung","CXCL8","CCL11","CCL5","CCR3_(gene)","Eosinophil","Neutrophil","Degranulation","Disulfide_bond","Cysteine","Molecular_mass","KDa","Gene","Primary_structure","Amino_acid","Primary_structure","Amino_acid","Tertiary_structure","Cysteine","Disulfide_bond","Protein_precursor","N-terminal_end","C-terminal_end","3_10_helix","Beta_strand","Alpha_helix","CCL1","CCR8","CCL2","CCR2","CCL3","CCR1","CCL4","CCR1","CCR5","CCL5","CCR5","CCL6","CCR1","CCL7","CCR2","CCL8","CCR1","CCR2B","CCR5","CCL9","CCL10","CCR1","CCL11","CCR2","CCR3_(gene)","CCR5","CCL12","CCL13","CCR2","CCR3_(gene)","CCR5","CCL14","CCR1","CCL15","CCR1","CCR3_(gene)","CCL16","CCR1","CCR2","CCR5","CCR8","CCL17","CCR4","CCL18","CCL19","CCR7","CCL20","CCR6","CCL21","CCR7","CCL22","CCR4","CCL23","CCR1","CCL24","CCR3_(gene)","CCL25","CCR9","CCL26","CCR3_(gene)","CCL27","CCR10","CCL28","CCR3_(gene)","CCR10","CXCL1","CXCR2","CXCL2","CXCR2","CXCL3","CXCR2","CXCL4","CXCR3B","CXCL5","CXCR2","CXCL6","CXCR1","CXCR2","CXCL7","Interleukin_8","CXCR1","CXCR2","CXCL9","CXCR3","CXCL10","CXCR3","CXCL11","CXCR3","CXCR7","CXCL12","CXCR4","CXCR7","CXCL13","CXCR5","CXCL14","CXCL15","CXCL16","CXCR6","CXCL17","XCL1","XCR1","XCL2","XCR1","CX3CL1","CX3CR1","Amino_acids","Amino_terminus","Ligand_(biochemistry)","CCL9","Monocyte","NK_cells","Dendritic_cells","CCL2","Macrophage","RANTES","Basophil","CCL11","Aging","Neurogenesis","Glutamic_acid","Leucine","Arginine","Neutrophil","Interleukin-8","CXCL13","CXC_chemokine_receptors","Lymphotactin","Lymphotactin","Fractalkine","Adhesion_molecule","Chemokine_receptor","G_protein-coupled_receptor","Transmembrane_helix","Leukocyte","CXC_chemokine_receptors","CC_chemokine_receptors","CX3CR1","XCR1","Amino_acid","Intracellular","Extracellular","Hydrophilic","Serine","Threonine","Cysteine","Cell_signaling","Enzyme","Phospholipase_C","Phosphatidylinositol_(4,5)-bisphosphate","Second_messenger","Inositol_triphosphate","Diglyceride","Protein_kinase_C","Calcium_in_biology","MAPK/ERK_pathway","Chemotaxis","Degranulation","Superoxide","Cell_adhesion_molecule","Integrin","RANTES","Macrophage_inflammatory_protein","HIV","HIV","Paracrine_signalling"]}
