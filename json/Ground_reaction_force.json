However, in a more general case, the GRF will also have a\ncomponent parallel to the ground, for example when the person is walking â a\nmotion that requires the exchange of horizontal (frictional) forces with the\nground. {{cite web\n | title = Ground Reaction Force publisher= Health Sciences Center, University\n | of Oklahoma date= 2002-04-03 url =\n | http://moon.ouhsc.edu/dthompso/gait/kinetics/GRFBKGND.HTM accessdate =2009-02-\n | 24}}\n\nThe use of the word reaction derives from Newton's third law, which essentially\nstates that if a force, called action, acts upon a body, then an equal and\nopposite force, called reaction, must act upon another body. The force exerted\nby the ground is conventionally referred to as the reaction, although, since the\ndistinction between action and reaction is completely arbitrary, the expression\nground action would be, in principle, equally acceptable.\n\nThe component of the GRF parallel to the surface is the frictional force. When\nslippage occurs the ratio of the magnitude of the frictional force to the normal\nforce yields the coefficient of static friction.

One of these groups studied often are athletes to help evaluate a\nsubjects ability to exert force and power. This can help create baseline\nparameters when creating strength and conditioning regimens from a\nrehabilitation and coaching stand point.Plyometric jumps such as a drop-jump is\nan activity often used to build greater power and force which can lead to overal\nbetter ability on the playing field. When landing from a safe height in a\nbilateral comparisons on GRF in relation to landing with the dominant foot first\nfollowed by the non-dominant limb, literature has shown was that there were no\nsignificances in bilateral components with landing with the dominant foot first\nfaster than the non-dominant foot on the GRF of the drop-jump or landing on\nvertical GRF output.
