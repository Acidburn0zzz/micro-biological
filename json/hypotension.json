[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hypotension TheFreeDictionary\n> hypotension]. Citing: The American Heritage Science Dictionary Copyright\n2005 Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the\narteries as the heart pumps out blood. Hypotension is generally considered to be\nsystolic blood pressure less than 90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or diastolic\nless than 60Â mm Hg. However in practice, blood pressure is considered too\nlow only if noticeable symptoms are present.\n\nHypotension is the opposite of hypertension, which is high blood pressure. It is\nbest understood as a physiological state, rather than a disease. It is often\nassociated with shock, though not necessarily indicative of it.\n\nFor some people who exercise and are in top physical condition, low blood\npressure is a sign of good health and fitness. For many people, low blood pressure can\ncause dizziness and fainting or indicate serious heart, endocrine or\nneurological disorders. Severely low blood pressure can deprive the brain and\nother vital organs of oxygen and nutrients, leading to a life-threatening\ncondition called shock.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"hypotension","recorded":1376428612,"links":[],"instances":["pharmacology","medicine","circulatory","small_intestine","physical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Vascular diseases","Hypotension"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Causes","Pathophysiology","Syndromes","Diagnosis","Treatment","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["systole","medicine"],["shock","circulatory"],["shock","circulatory"],["fatigue","physical"],["glyceryl_trinitrate","pharmacology"],["absorption","small_intestine"]],"members":["glyceryl_trinitrate","systole","shock","absorption","fatigue"],"related":["Physiology","Medicine","Blood_pressure","Arteries","Systemic_circulation","Blood_pressure","Systole_(medicine)","Hypertension","Physiologic","Shock_(circulatory)","Neurological_disorders","Shock_(circulatory)","Lightheadedness","Dizziness","Fainting","Seizure","Chest_pain","Shortness_of_breath","Irregular_heartbeat","Fever","Headache","Upper_back_pain","Cough","Phlegm","Diarrhea","Vomiting","Dyspepsia","Dysuria","Medications","Allergic_reaction","Seizures","Loss_of_consciousness","Fatigue_(physical)","Ehlers-Danlos_Syndrome","Peptic_ulcer","Anemia","Hypovolemia","Hemorrhage","Diuretic","Alpha_blockers","Beta_blockers","Beta_blocker","Cardiac_output","Congestive_heart_failure","Myocardial_infarction","Bradycardia","Cardiogenic_shock","Arrhythmia","Vasodilation","Arterioles","Dysautonomia","Sepsis","Acidosis","Glyceryl_trinitrate_(pharmacology)","Calcium_channel_blockers","Angiotensin_II_receptor_type_1","Spinal_anesthesia","Inhalational_anaesthetic","Vasodilation","Meditation","Yoga","Botanical","Theobromine","Theobroma_cacao","Vasodilator","Diuretic","Autonomic_nervous_system","Sensory_receptors","Nerve","Hormone","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Parasympathetic_nervous_system","Orthostatic_hypotension","Hypovolemia","Antidepressant","Neurocardiogenic_syncope","Vasovagal_syncope","Vagus_nerve","Postprandial","Intestines","Splanchnic","Digestion","Absorption_(small_intestine)","Cardiac_output","Vasoconstriction","Blood_pressure","Hypertension","Neurocardiogenic_syncope","Tilt_table_test","Electrolytes","Caffeine","Trendelenburg_position","The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine","Iv_colloid","Vasopressor","Steroids","Adrenal_insufficiency","Ileus","Dysautonomia","Hypotensive_transfusion_reaction","Orthostatic_intolerance","WebMD"]}
