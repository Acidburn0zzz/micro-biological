{"cursor":"9185","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" in competition.]] 'English riding' is a form of horse riding seen throughout\n the world. There are many variations, but all feature a flat English saddle\n without the deep seat, high cantle or saddle horn seen on a Western saddle nor\n the knee pads seen on an Australian Stock Saddle. Saddles within the various\n English disciplines are all designed to allow the horse the freedom to move in\n the optimal manner for a given task, ranging from classical dressage to horse\n racing. English bridles also vary in style based on discipline, but most\n feature some type of cavesson noseband as well as closed reins, buckled\n together at the ends, that prevents them from dropping on the ground if a rider\n becomes unseated. Clothing for riders in competition is usually based on\n traditional needs from which a specific style of riding developed, but most\n standards require, as a minimum, boots; breeches or jodhpurs; a shirt with some\n form of tie or stock; a hat, cap, or equestrian helmet; and a jacket.\n\nEnglish riding is an equestrian discipline with many different styles, however,\nat the most basic level, most versions require riders to use both hands on the\nreins, rather than just one hand, as is seen in western riding. Riders also\nfrequently \"post\" or \"rise\" to the trot called \"posting trot\" (rising and\nsitting in rhythm with each stride) in many circumstances, although there are\nalso times when English riders may sit the trot called \"sitting trot\".\n","linknr":-1,"url":"English_riding","recorded":1376429046,"links":[],"instances":["british"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Equestrianism"],"headings":["Types","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["show_hunter","british"],["show_hunter","british"]],"members":["show_hunter"],"related":["Equestrianism","English_saddle","Western_saddle","Australian_Stock_Saddle","Saddle","Classical_dressage","Horse_racing","Noseband","Equestrian_helmet","Western_riding","Pony_Club","Equestrian_at_the_Summer_Olympics","Classical_dressage","Spanish_Riding_School","Dressage","International_Equestrian_Federation","Equestrian_at_the_Summer_Olympics","Para-equestrian","International_Equestrian_Federation","Paralympic","Endurance_riding","International_Equestrian_Federation","Eventing","Cross-country_equestrianism","International_Equestrian_Federation","Equestrian_at_the_Summer_Olympics","Horse_racing","Horseball","International_Equestrian_Federation","Polo","Cowboy_polo","Polocrosse","Lacrosse","Australia","Show_jumping","International_Equestrian_Federation","Equestrian_at_the_Summer_Olympics","Tent_Pegging","International_Equestrian_Federation","United_States","Canada","Hunt_seat","United_States","Saddle_seat","South_Africa","Show_hunter","English_pleasure","Show_hack","Hunter_hack","Equitation","Australia","Riding_Horse","Show_hack","Show_hunter_(British)","Show_hunter_(British)","Campdrafting","Australian","Cattle","Australian_stock_saddle","Equitation","Sidesaddle","Equestrianism","English_saddle","Bridle","Horse_show","United_States_Equestrian_Federation","International_Federation_for_Equestrian_Sports","Equestrian_helmet"]}
