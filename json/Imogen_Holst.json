{"cursor":"5276","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Imogen Clare Holst', CBE (12 April 19079 March 1984) was a British composer and\nconductor, and sole child of composer Gustav Holst.\n\nImogen Holst was brought up in west London and educated at the Froebel\nDemonstration School and St Paul's Girls' School, where her father was director\nof music. She worked with Herbert Howells before entering the Royal College of\nMusic (RCM) in 1926 to study composition with George Dyson and Gordon Jacob,\nharmony and counterpoint with Ralph Vaughan Williams, and conducting with\nWilliam H. Reed. She won several prizes for composition including the Cobbett\nPrize for a string quartet (1928).\n\nIn 1931 Holst began earning her living as a freelance musician, though her hopes\nof being a concert pianist were dashed by incipient phlebitis in her left arm.\n\nIn April 1939 Holst went to Switzerland to study, and she returned just before\nthe outbreak of war. She served on the Bloomsbury House Refugee Committee,\nworking with musicians from Austria and Germany. In January 1940 was appointed\nby Sir Walford Davies to be one of six musicians charged with inspiring and\norganising musical activities among civilians in rural areas. The scheme,\noriginally funded by the Pilgrim Trust, was taken over by the newly formed\nCouncil for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, forerunner of the Arts\nCouncil of Great Britain.\n\nIn July 1951 she resumed her freelance career, and in the autumn of 1952 the\ncomposer Benjamin Britten asked her to come to Aldeburgh, Suffolk, to help with\nhis opera [[Gloriana]]. She had first met him and his partner, the tenor Peter\nPears, in the 1940s and they became close friends. She lived in Aldeburgh (in a\nhouse designed by architect, H. T. Cadbury-Brown) for the rest of her life,\ninitially working closely with Britten both as his music assistant and for the\nAldeburgh Festival, of which she was an artistic director from 1956 to 1977.\n\nIn 1953 she arranged for string orchestra William Byrd's keyboard setting of an\nold Irish tune, Sellinger's Round. This became the basis of the [[Variations on\nan Elizabethan Theme]], jointly composed by Britten, Lennox Berkeley, Arthur\nOldham, Michael Tippett and William Walton. The work was premiered at the 1953\nAldeburgh Festival, in honour of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. [htt-\np://www.brittenpears.org/?page=research/catalogue/detail.html&id=246 Britten-\nPears Foundation]\n\nIn 1963 she published An ABC of Music, an introduction to music theory, which is\nstill in print.\n\nIn 1964 Imogen Holst left Aldeburgh to concentrate on recording and editing the\nmusic of her father. With composer Colin Matthews she edited scholarly editions\nof her father's works (including four volumes of facsimiles) and compiled A\nThematic Catalogue of Gustav Holst's Music (1974).\n\nShe was appointed a fellow of the RCM in 1966, an honorary member of the Royal\nAcademy of Music in 1970 and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire\n(CBE) in 1975. She received honorary doctorates from the universities of Essex\n(1968), Exeter (1969), and Leeds (1983).\n\nShe died in March 1984, aged 76, and is buried in the churchyard of Saint Peter\nand Saint Paul's Church in Aldeburgh. Her grave can be found directly behind\nthose of Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears. She never married.\n\nIn 2007, Boydell Press published Imogen Holst: A Life in\nMusic, [http://www.boydell.co.uk/43832968.HTM Imogen Holst Life in Music,\n1843832968, Â£25.00/$47.95, 514pp, 2007] edited by Christopher Grogan and\nRosamund Strode, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of her
