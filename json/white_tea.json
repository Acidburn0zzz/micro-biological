{"cursor":"11040","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n tea leaves.]] 'White tea' is a lightly oxidized tea grown and harvested\n primarily in China, mostly in the Fujian province. More recently it is grown in Taiwan, India, Northern\n Thailand and Eastern Nepal.\n\nWhite tea comes from the buds and leaves of the Chinese [[Camellia sinensis]]\nplant. The leaves and buds are allowed to wither in natural sunlight before they\nare lightly processed to prevent oxidation or further tea processing.\n\nThe name \"white tea\" derives from the fine silvery-white hairs on the unopened\nbuds of the tea plant, which gives the plant a whitish appearance. The beverage itself is not white or colourless but\npale yellow.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"white_tea","recorded":1376429407,"links":[],"instances":["white"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chinese tea","White tea|*"],"headings":["History","Contents","Manufacturing","Health","See also","Notes","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["darjeeling_tea","white"]],"members":["darjeeling_tea"],"related":["Tea","China","Fujian","Bud","Redox","Black_tea","Green_tea","Polyphenols_in_tea","Tea_catechins","Atherosclerotic_plaques","Stroke","Cancer","Pekoe","Health_effects_of_tea","Catechins","Polyphenol","Antioxidants","Cholesterol","Cardiovascular_disease","Pace_University","Staphylococcus","Streptococcus","Pneumonia","Dental_plaque","University_Hospitals_of_Cleveland","Case_Western_Reserve_University","Linus_Pauling_Institute","Oregon_State_University","Sulindac","Kingston_University","Anti-inflammatory","Antioxidant","Collagenase","Elastase","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Cancer","Heart_disease","Enzyme_catalysis","Elastin","Collagen","Aging","Silver_Needle_tea","White_Peony_Tea","Shou_Mei_tea","Darjeeling_tea_(white)","CRC_Press","CRC_Press","Science_Daily","Science_Daily"]}
