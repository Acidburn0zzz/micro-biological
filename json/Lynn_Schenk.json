She served one term in the United States House of\nRepresentatives, from 1993 to 1995.\n\nSchenk was born in 1945, in the Bronx, the daughter of a Holocaust\nsurvivor. San Diego Jewish Journal, October 2003 She attended public\nschools in the Bronx and Los Angeles, and graduated from Hamilton High School.\nShe received her B.A. from U.C.L.A. in 1967 and her J.D. from the University of\nSan Diego School of Law in 1970. There were only three other women in her law\nclass. Schenk did post-graduate study in international law at the London School\nof Economics.\n\nIn 1971, with two other female lawyers, Schenk broke the gender barrier at The\nGrant Grill in the downtown San Diego U. S. Grant Hotel. Women were prohibited\nduring lunch, so a male friend made a reservation and the three women went in to\neat, unescorted. They ordered mock turtle soup, a specialty not available in the\nhotelâs other restaurants.\n\nAfter trying to push them out the door, the staff seated them. The three\ncontinued to come back until a \"No women before 3 p.m.\" sign was removed. The\nnext year, she and other women formed the Lawyers Club of San\nDiego, [http://lawyersclubsandiego.com/displaycommon.cfm?an=4 History page\nat Lawyers Club of San Diego website.] which worked for passage of the\nEqual Rights Amendment and on other women's rights issues.\n\nSchenk worked as a White House Fellow, under Vice Presidents Nelson A.\nRockefeller and Walter Mondale, as a deputy attorney general in the office of\nthe California Attorney General, and as an attorney for San Diego Gas and\nElectric. California Governor Jerry Brown appointed her deputy secretary, and\nlater secretary, of the California Business, Transportation and Housing Agency\nfrom 1977 until 1983. After Brown decided not to run for a third term, she\nreturned to private practice.\n\nIn 1984, she ran against Republican Susan Golding for San Diego County\nSupervisor. Late in the race, Golding's campaign allegedly mailed out a piece of\nliterature accusing Schenk of financial irregularities. Schenk lost 45% to 55%.\nReportedly, she later sued Golding for slander and settled out-of-court with\nGolding's insurers in 1988.\n\nIn 1992, Schenk won the Democratic nomination to run for Congress from\nCalifornia's 49th congressional district, covering most of San Diego.\nRedistricting after the 1990 U.S. Census had created an open seat in much of an\narea previously represented by six-term Republican incumbent Bill Lowery. Schenk\nwon, becoming the first Democrat to represent the area in 40 years. She was\ndefeated for reelection in 1994 by Brian Bilbray, the Republican mayor of\nImperial Beach.\n\nAfter serving in Congress, Schenk served in various positions in the California\nstate government under California Governor Gray Davis, including Chief of Staff,\nfrom 1998 until Davis was recalled in 2003. As Chief of Staff, she didn't\n\"suffer fools\" and was responsible for much of the âcentristâ policy of the\nDavis Administration.\n\nCurrently, Schenk practices corporate law. She sits on the boards of various\norganizations including The Scripps Research Institute Board of Trustees, and\nthe California High-Speed Rail Authority\n\nShe remains active in California and national politics.\n\nSchenk was married to University of San Diego law professor C. Hugh Friedman,\nwho died on January 29, 2013. Schenk lives in San Diego.\n\nSchenk has served on the board of the California High Speed Rail Authority\nsince 2003 when she was appointed by Gov. Gray Davis. She serves as Vice\nChairperson in 2011.\n\nLynn Schenk was nominated and inducted into the Women's Hall of Fame in 2012 for\nthe title of Trailblazer, meaning, women who have paved the way for other women,\nor were the first in their field. The annual Women's Hall of Fame induction is\nco-hosted by Women's Museum of California (Located in San Diego), Commission on\nthe Status of Women, UC San Diego Women's Center, and San Diego State Women's\nStudies.\n","linknr":180,"url":"Lynn_Schenk","recorded":1376420238,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Lynn_Schenk&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lynn_Schenk&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Schenk","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lynn_Schenk&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Lynn_Schenk.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Lynn_Schenk.jpg","/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/California","/wiki/California%27s_49th_congressional_district","/wiki/Brian_Bilbray","/wiki/The_Bronx","/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Judaism","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/U.S._Democratic_Party","/wiki/Politician","/wiki/California","/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/The_Bronx","/wiki/The_Holocaust","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Los_Angeles","/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton_High_School_(Los_Angeles,_California)","/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts","/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles","/wiki/Juris_Doctor","/wiki/University_of_San_Diego_School_of_Law","/wiki/London_School_of_Economics","/wiki/San_Diego","/wiki/U._S._Grant_Hotel","/wiki/Mock_turtle_soup","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment","/wiki/White_House_Fellow","/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Nelson_A._Rockefeller","/wiki/Walter_Mondale","/wiki/California_Attorney_General","/wiki/San_Diego_Gas_and_Electric","/wiki/California_Governor","/wiki/Jerry_Brown","/wiki/California_Business,_Transportation_and_Housing_Agency","/wiki/United_States_Republican_Party","/wiki/Susan_Golding","/wiki/San_Diego_County","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/U.S._Congress","/wiki/California%27s_49th_congressional_district","/wiki/Gerrymander","/wiki/1990_U.S._Census","/wiki/Bill_Lowery_(US_politician)","/wiki/Brian_Bilbray","/wiki/Imperial_Beach,_California","/wiki/Gray_Davis","/wiki/2003_California_recall","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items","/wiki/The_Scripps_Research_Institute","/wiki/California_High-Speed_Rail_Authority","/wiki/University_of_San_Diego","/wiki/Law_professor","#cite_note-Women.27s_Museum_of_California-3","/w/index.php?title=Lynn_Schenk&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Lynn_Schenk&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego","/wiki/San_Diego_State_University","/w/index.php?title=Lynn_Schenk&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Lynn_Schenk&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://lawyersclubsandiego.com/displaycommon.cfm?an=4","#cite_ref-Women.27s_Museum_of_California_3-0","http://womensmuseumca.org/whof/","/w/index.php?title=Lynn_Schenk&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Lynn_Schenk&veaction=edit&section=3","http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=S000119","/wiki/Biographical_Directory_of_the_United_States_Congress","http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/S000119","/wiki/The_Washington_Post","/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/List_of_United_States_Representatives_from_California","/wiki/California%27s_49th_congressional_district","/wiki/Brian_Bilbray","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/170979973","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/The_Bronx","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lynn_Schenk&oldid=565690710","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1945_births","/wiki/Category:Jewish_American_politicians","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives_from_California","/wiki/Category:People_from_San_Diego,_California","/wiki/Category:Female_members_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/Category:Women_in_California_politics","/wiki/C
