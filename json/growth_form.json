{"cursor":"9900","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Plant life-form' schemes constitute a way of classifying plants alternatively\nto the ordinary species-genus-family scientific classification. In colloquial\nspeech, plants may be classified as trees, shrubs, herbs (forbs and graminoids),\netc. The scientific use of life-form schemes emphasizes plant function in the\necosystem and that the same function or \"adaptedness\" to the environment may be\nachieved in a number of ways, i.e. plant species that are closely related\nphylogenetically may have widely different life-form, for example [[Adoxa]] and\n[[Sambucus]] are from the same family, but the former is a small herbaceous\nplant and the latter is a shrub or tree. Conversely, unrelated species may share\na life-form through convergent evolution. The most widely applied life-form\nscheme is the RaunkiÃ¦r system.\n\nLife-form and growth-form are essentially synonymous concepts, despite attempts\nto restrict the meaning of growth-form to types differing in shoot\narchitecture.
