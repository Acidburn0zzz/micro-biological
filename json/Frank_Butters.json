He trained for\ntwo of the most successful owner-breeders in British racing at the time, Lord\nDerby and HH Aga Khan III, and was British flat racing Champion Trainer on eight\noccasions.\n\nFrank Butters was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1878 while his father Joseph\nButters was training racehorses there. He was educated in Britain but returned\nto Austria as an assistant to his father. He was interned in Austria during\nWorld War I and trained in Italy after the war.\n\nIn 1926 he returned to Britain to start a four-year contract as Lord Derby's\ntrainer at Stanley House stables in Newmarket in succession to George Lambton.\nHe trained a number of Classic winners for the Earl and also trained for other\nowners, winning the Epsom Oaks in 1927 for the Earl of Durham. In 1930 Lord\nDerby terminated Butters' employment but he set up as a public trainer and when\nthe Aga Khan split with Dick Dawson, Butters took over as his trainer.\n\nHe trained for the Aga Khan until forced to retire after a serious bicycle\naccident in 1949. In that period he trained nine Classic winners for the Aga\nKhan including Mahmoud, who won the 1936 Epsom Derby in a then-record time, and\nthe unbeaten 1935 Triple Crown winner Bahram. He also trained the Epsom Oaks\nwinner Steady Aim for Sir Alfred Butt, plus three winners of the Irish Derby for\nthe Aga Khan and won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe with Migoli in 1948. His win\nwith Migoli in the \"Arc\" was the first for an English-trained horse since 1923\nand there would not be another until 1971.\n\nHe trained 1,019 winners in Great Britain and was Champion Trainer in 1927,\n1928, 1932, 1934, 1935, 1944, 1946 and 1949. In 1934 he trained the winners of\nnine of the 28 races at Royal Ascot. His brother, Fred Butters, was also a\ntrainer and won the 1937 Epsom Derby with Mid-day Sun.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Frank_Butters","recorded":1376426560,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Frank_Butters&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Butters&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Horse_trainer","/wiki/Vienna","/wiki/Austria","/wiki/Princess_of_Wales%27s_Stakes","/wiki/Eclipse_Stakes","/wiki/Champion_Stakes","/wiki/Jockey_Club_Stakes","/wiki/Dewhurst_Stakes","/wiki/Irish_Derby_Stakes","/wiki/British_Classic_Races","/wiki/2,000_Guineas_Stakes","/wiki/1,000_Guineas_Stakes","/wiki/Epsom_Derby","/wiki/Epsom_Oaks","/wiki/St._Leger_Stakes","/wiki/French_Classic_Races","/wiki/Prix_de_l%27Arc_de_Triomphe","/wiki/British_flat_racing_Champion_Trainer","/wiki/Fairway_(horse)","/w/index.php?title=Beam_(horse)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Mahmoud_(horse)","/wiki/Bahram_(horse)","/wiki/Migoli","/wiki/Horse_racing","/wiki/Horse_trainer","/wiki/Flat_racing","/wiki/Austria","/wiki/Italy","/wiki/England","/wiki/Edward_Stanley,_17th_Earl_of_Derby","/wiki/Aga_Khan_III","/wiki/British_flat_racing_Champion_Trainer","/wiki/Vienna","/wiki/Internment","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Newmarket,_Suffolk","/wiki/George_Lambton","/wiki/British_Classic_Races","/wiki/Epsom_Oaks","/wiki/John_Lambton,_3rd_Earl_of_Durham","/wiki/Richard_C._Dawson","/wiki/Mahmoud_(horse)","/wiki/Epsom_Derby","/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing","/wiki/Bahram_(horse)","/wiki/Epsom_Oaks","/wiki/Alfred_Butt","/wiki/Irish_Derby_Stakes","/wiki/Prix_de_l%27Arc_de_Triomphe","/wiki/Migoli","/wiki/Royal_Ascot","/w/index.php?title=Fred_Butters&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Mid-day_Sun","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Butters&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/1,000_Guineas_Stakes","/wiki/2,000_Guineas_Stakes","/wiki/Epsom_Oaks","/wiki/Epsom_Derby","/wiki/St._Leger_Stakes","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Butters&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Traenkel_Mautner_Butters_1901_Adler.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Traenkel_Mautner_Butters_1901_Adler.jpg/220px-Traenkel_Mautner_Butters_1901_Adler.jpg","/wiki/File:Traenkel_Mautner_Butters_1901_Adler.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Stallion","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-7090-2639-0","http://www.horseracinghistory.co.uk/hrho/action/viewDocument?id=892","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Butters&oldid=542910093","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1878_births","/wiki/Category:1957_deaths","/wiki/Category:British_horse_trainers","/wiki/Category:People_from_Vienna","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Frank+Butters&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Frank+Butters","/wiki/Frank_Butters","/wiki/Talk:Frank_Butters","#","/wiki/Frank_Butters","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Butters&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Butters&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Frank_Butters","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Frank_Butters","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Butters&oldid=542910093","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Butters&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5485586","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Frank_Butters&id=542910093","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Frank+Butters","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Frank+Butters&oldid=542910093&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Butters&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5485586#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unp
