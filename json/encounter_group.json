{"cursor":"5908","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n__NOTOC__ A 'T-group' or 'training group' (sometimes also referred to as\n'[[sensitivity training|sensitivity-training]] group, human relations training\ngroup' or 'encounter group') is a form of group training where participants\nthemselves (typically, between eight and 15 people) learn about themselves (and\nabout small group processes in general) through their interaction with each\nother. They use feedback, problem solving, and role play to gain insights into\nthemselves, others, and groups.\n\nThe concept of encounter as \"a meeting of two, eye to eye, face to face,\" was\narticulated by J.L. Moreno in Vienna in 1914-15, in his \"Einladung zu Einer\nBegegnung\" (\"Invitation to an Encounter\"), maturing into his psychodrama\ntherapy. It was pioneered in the mid-1940s by Moreno's protege Kurt Lewin and\nhis colleagues as a method of learning about human behavior in what became\nThe National Training Laboratories (now NTL Institute of Behavioral Science)\nthat was created by the Office of Naval Research and the National Education\nAssociation in Bethel, Maine, in 1947. First conceived as a research\ntechnique with a goal to change the standards, attitudes and behavior of\nindividuals, the T-group evolved into educational and treatment schemes for\nnon-psychiatric people.\n\nA T-group meeting does not have an explicit agenda, structure, or express goal.\nUnder the guidance of a facilitator, the participants are encouraged to share\nemotional reactions (such as, for example, anger, fear, warmth, or envy) that\narise in response to their fellow participants' actions and statements. The\nemphasis is on sharing emotions, as opposed to judgments or conclusions. In this\nway, T-group participants can learn how their words and actions trigger\nemotional responses in the people they communicate with. Many varieties of T-\ngroups have existed, from the initial T-groups that focused on small group\ndynamics, to those that aim more explicitly to develop self-understanding and\ninterpersonal communication. Industry also widely used T-groups, particularly in\nthe 1960s and 1970s, and in many ways these were predecessors of current team\nbuilding and corporate culture initiatives.\n\nCarl Rogers reportedly described the T-group as \"...the most significant social\ninvention of the century.\" A number of experimental studies have been undertaken\nwith the aim of determining what effects, if any, participating in a T-group has\non the participants. For example, a 1975 article by Nancy E. Adler and Daniel\nGoleman concluded that \"Students who had participated in a T-group showed\nsignificantly more change toward their selected goal than those who had not.\"\n\nThis type of training is controversial as the behaviors it encourages are often\nself-disclosure and openness, which many people believe some organizations\nultimately punish. The feedback used in this type of training can be highly\npersonal, hence it must be given by highly trained observers (trainers).. In the\nNTL-tradition, the T-group is always embedded in a Human Interaction Laboratory,\nwith reflection time and theory sessions. In these sessions, the participants\nhave the opportunity to make sense of what's happening in the T-group.\n\nA more recent version of the T-groups is the Appreciative Inquiry Human\nInteraction Laboratory, which focusses on strengths-based learning processes.\nIt's a variation of the NTL T-groups, since it shares the values and\nexperiential learning model with the classic T-groups.\n\nEncounter groups are also controversial because they can cause serious and\nlasting psychological damage. One 1971 study Yalom ID Lieberman MA, A Study\nof Encounter Group Casualties, Archives of General Psychiatry, 1971;25(1):16-30.\ndoi:10.1001/archpsyc.1971.01750130018002\nhttp://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=490477 found that\n9% of normal college students participating in an encounter group developed\npsychological problems lasting at least six months after their experience. The\nmost dangerous groups had authoritarian and charismatic leaders who used vicious\nemotional attacks and public humiliation to try to break participants.\n\nA commercialized strand of the encounter group movement developed into large-\ngroup awareness training. Other variations have included the nude encounter\ngroup, where participants are naked, and the marathon encounter group, where\nparticipants carry on for 24 hours or longer without sleep.\n","linknr":127,"url":"encounter_group","recorded":1376429237,"links":["/w/index.php?title=T-groups&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=T-groups&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-groups","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Encounter_group&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/T-group_(mathematics)","/wiki/Sensitivity_training","/wiki/Role-playing","/wiki/J.L._Moreno","/wiki/Psychodrama","/wiki/Kurt_Lewin","/wiki/National_Training_Laboratories","/w/index.php?title=NTL_Institute_of_Behavioral_Science&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Office_of_Naval_Research","/wiki/Bethel,_Maine","/wiki/Team_building","/wiki/Corporate_culture","/wiki/Carl_Rogers","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Daniel_Goleman","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Large-group_awareness_training","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=T-groups&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=T-groups&veaction=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/encounter_group","/wiki/Sensitivity_training","/wiki/Group_dynamics","/wiki/National_Lampoon%27s_Animal_House","/wiki/Appreciative_Inquiry","/w/index.php?title=T-groups&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=T-groups&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/William_Schutz","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-465-01968-4","/w/index.php?title=T-groups&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=T-groups&veaction=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=490477","#cite_ref-2","http://books.google.co.uk/books?client=firefox-a&id=QZ5FAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22nude+encounter%22&q=divested#search_anchor","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780060443788_(4th_Edition)","/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#bad_isbn","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0716716062","/w/index.php?title=T-groups&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=T-groups&veaction=edit&section=4","http://www.shapingtheparish.com/storage/About%20T-groups.pdf","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=T-groups&oldid=567202301","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Social_psychology","/wiki/Category:Group_processes","/wiki/Category:United_States_Navy","/wiki/Category:Pages_with_ISBN_errors","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_July_2013","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_October_2011","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=T-groups&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=T-groups","/wiki/T-groups","/wiki/Talk:T-groups","#","/wiki/T-groups","/w/index.php?title=T-groups&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=T-groups&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=T-groups&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/T-groups","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/T-groups","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=T-groups&oldid=567202301","/w/index.php?title=T-groups&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11291290","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=T-groups&id=567202301","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=T-groups","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=T-groups&oldid=567202301&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=T-groups&printable=yes","//bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2-%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%B8","//de.wi
