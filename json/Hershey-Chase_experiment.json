While DNA had been known to\nbiologists since 1869, a few scientists still assumed at the time\nthat proteins carried the information for inheritance. In their experiments,\nHershey and Chase showed that when bacteriophages, which are composed of DNA and\nprotein, infect bacteria, their DNA enters the host bacterial cell, but most of\ntheir protein does not. Although the results were not conclusive, and Hershey\nand Chase were cautious in their interpretation, previous, contemporaneous and\nsubsequent discoveries all served to prove that DNA is the hereditary material.\nKnowledge of DNA gained from these discoveries has applications in forensics,\ncrime investigation and genealogy.\n\nHershey shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Max DelbrÃ¼ck\nand Salvador Luria for their âdiscoveries concerning the genetic structure of\nviruses.â {{cite web\n | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969/index.html\n | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1969 accessdate = 2011-04-\n | 06 publisher = Nobel Foundation\n}}\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Hershey-Chase_experiment","recorded":1376418395,"links":[],"instances":["genetic_descendant","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetics experiments","Bacteriophages","1952 in science"],"headings":["Historical background","Methods and results","Discussion","Legacy","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["progeny","genetic_descendant"],["transcription","genetics"],["translation","biology"]],"members":["progeny","translation","transcription"],"related":["Experiment","Alfred_Hershey","Martha_Chase","DNA","Genetic_material","Biologist","Protein","Bacteriophage","Forensics","Crime_investigation","Genealogy","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Max_Delbrück","Salvador_Luria","Phoebus_Levene","Nucleotides","Avery-MacLeod-McCarty_experiment","Frederick_Griffith","Oswald_Avery","Colin_Munro_MacLeod","Maclyn_McCarty","Virulent","Isotope","Radionuclide","T2_phage","Progeny_(genetic_descendant)","Deoxyribonuclease","DNase","Enzyme","Plasmolysis","Adsorb","Viral_entry","Lysis","James_D._Watson","Francis_Crick","Double_helix","DNA_replication","X-ray_crystallography","Maurice_Wilkins","Rosalind_Franklin","George_Gamow","Genetic_code","Codons","Gene_expression","Protein_synthesis","Transcription_(genetics)","RNA_splicing","Translation_(biology)","Post-translational_modification","Recombinant_DNA","Bacteriophages","Model_organism","Genetic_material","Host_cell","Avery-MacLeod-McCarty_experiment","DNA","Forensic_science","Crime_investigation","Genealogy","DNA_fingerprinting","Genetic_variation"]}
