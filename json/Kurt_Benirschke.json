He immigrated to the\nUnited States in 1949.\n\nAfter an internship in New Jersey, he trained in pathology at university\nhospitals affiliated with Harvard Medical School in Boston. In 1955, he became\npathologist of the Boston Lying-in Hospital, now part of the Brigham and\nWomen's Hospital, and there developed his interest in the placenta and\nreproductive problems.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1970 he was the chairman of the department of pathology at\nDartmouth Medical School in Hanover, New Hampshire and pursued his interests in\nplacental pathology and comparative reproductive pathology. He there developed a\npassion for comparative cytogenetics, discovering the reason for the sterility\nof mules and investigating twinning in armadillos and marmosets.\n\nIn 1970, Benirschke moved west to participate in the development of a new\nmedical school of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). He established\na genetics laboratory and ran the autopsy service at UCSD. He also chaired the\ndepartment of pathology for two years.\n\nIn 1976, Benirschke persuaded the Board of Trustees of the San Diego Zoo to\nestablish a formal research department. Benirschke led this new research\ndepartment, which was named the Center for the Reproduction of Endangered\nSpecies, until 1987 when he became a member of the Zoo's Board of Trustees. He\nset up a laboratory at the Zoo to study the chromosomes of mammals, particularly\naspects relating to reproduction and evolution. In collaboration with T.C. Hsu\nhe published an Atlas of Mammalian Chromosomes presenting the karyotypes of 400\ndifferent species of mammals.\n\nHe established at the Zoo a collection of frozen cells and reproductive material\nfrom dozens of highly endangered species that became famous as the first \"Frozen\nZoo\". In the 1970s when he began this collection, there was no technology\navailable to make use of it, but he quoted Daniel Boorstin: \"You must collect\nthings for reasons you don't yet understand.\" The Frozen Zoo eventually became a\npriceless genetic\nresource. [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/14/tech/main525521.shtml\nCBS News]\n\nThroughout his career he moved freely back and forth between human medicine and\nanimal medicine. This inspired the title One Medicine given to a Festschrift\nwritten by 50 of his colleagues to honor his 60th birthday. In the introduction,\nO. A. Ryder and M. L. Byrd state, \"The acknowledgment that the underlying\nmechanisms of cellular function and organismal development are highly similar\namong animals provides the impetus for the title of this volume, One Medicine.\nIt is a tribute to Prof. Kurt Benirschke from his students and colleagues. As\nsuch, we attempt to recognize the breadth and depth of his thinking and to\nacknowledge the significant role he has played in aspects of human medicine,\nveterinary medicine, and wildlife conservation.\" [http://books.google.com/books?id=EzU-\n5RHc7UYC&dq=one+medicine+benirschke&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=3OJJuxFuv-\n7&sig=Z_w4PnIeO82ilLfdIh3FcIGDCzA&hl=en&ei=EMNBSsTuDJKgM5n80MEH&sa=X&oi=book_re-\nsult&ct=result&resnum=1 One Medicine], edited by Oliver A. Ryder and Mary J.\nByrd, Springer-Verlag, 1984, page 1\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in\n1994. The same year, he retired from the faculty at UCSD\nbut continued to be as active. From 1997-2000 he was president of the Zoo's\nBoard of Trustees and looked after the \"Proyecto Tagua\" in Paraguay, a breeding\nfacility of the newly discovered species of peccary. His text (with Peter\nKaufmann) on Human Placental Pathology is the standard text on the subject.\n\nBenirschke is a member of many societies and authored 30 books and 510\nscientific publications. He met his wife, a nurse, during his internship and has\nthree children, 2 sons and a daughter. Dr. Stephen Benirschke, who lives in\nSeattle and is a foot and ankle Orthopedic Surgeon most known for his specialty\nwith the calcaneus fracture surgery. The other son, Rolf Benirschke, was a\ncelebrated kicker for the San Diego Chargers in the National Football League.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Kurt_Benirschke","recorded":1376425952,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Kurt_Benirschke&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Kurt_Benirschke&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Benirschke","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Gl%C3%BCckstadt","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/San_Diego","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/University_of_Hamburg","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Pathologist","/wiki/Geneticist","/wiki/Placenta","/wiki/Reproduction","/wiki/University_of_Hamburg","/wiki/New_Jersey","/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School","/wiki/Boston","/wiki/Brigham_and_Women%27s_Hospital","/wiki/Dartmouth_Medical_School","/wiki/Hanover,_New_Hampshire","/wiki/Infertility","/wiki/Mule","/wiki/Twin","/wiki/Armadillo","/wiki/Marmoset","/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego","/wiki/Autopsy","/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo","/wiki/Chromosome","/wiki/Mammal","/wiki/T.C._Hsu","/wiki/Karyotype","/wiki/Frozen_Zoo","/wiki/Daniel_Boorstin","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Festschrift","#cite_note-2","/wiki/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences","#cite_note-AAAS-3","/wiki/Paraguay","/wiki/Peccary","/wiki/Rolf_Benirschke","/wiki/National_Football_League","/w/index.php?title=Kurt_Benirschke&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Kurt_Benirschke&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/14/tech/main525521.shtml","#cite_ref-2","http://books.google.com/books?id=EzU-5RHc7UYC&dq=one+medicine+benirschke&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=3OJJuxFuv7&sig=Z_w4PnIeO82ilLfdIh3FcIGDCzA&hl=en&ei=EMNBSsTuDJKgM5n80MEH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1","#cite_ref-AAAS_3-0","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Kurt_Benirschke&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Kurt_Benirschke&veaction=edit&section=2","http://placentation.ucsd.edu/index.html","http://www.biologia.uniba.it/eca/NEWSLETTER/NS-14/06-Benirschke.html","http://www.sandiego-online.com/issues/june96/dandydad.htm","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/9908788","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Gl%C3%BCckstadt","/wiki/Germany","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kurt_Benirschke&oldid=560916490","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1924_births","/wiki/Category:American_geneticists","/wiki/Category:American_pathologists","/wiki/Category:American_zoologists","/wiki/Category:Physicians_from_California","/wiki/Category:Geisel_School_of_Medicine_faculty","/wiki/Category:Fellows_of_the_American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences","/wiki/Category:German_emigrants_to_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Harvard_Medical_School_people","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:University_of_California,_San_Diego_faculty","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Kurt+Benirschke&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Kurt+Benirschke","/wiki/Kurt_Benirschke","/wiki/Talk:Kurt_Benirschke","#","/wiki/Kurt_Benirschke","/w/index.php?title=Kurt_Benirschke&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Kurt_Benirschke&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Kurt_Benirschke&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Kurt_Benirschke","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Kurt_Benirschke","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Kurt_Benirschke&oldid=560916490","/w/inde
