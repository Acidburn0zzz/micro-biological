They typically have brown, black, white, or mixed fur.\nThey have an average length of 20 inches (51 cm) including a\n5 inch (13 cm) tail, weigh about }}, and have a natural lifespan of 7\nto 10 years.

Retrieved on 2012-02-\n28. Ferrets are sexually dimorphic predators with males being\nsubstantially larger than females.\n\nSeveral other small, elongated carnivorous mammals belonging to the Mustelidae\nfamily also have the word ferret in their common names, including an endangered\nspecies, the Black-footed Ferret. The ferret is a very close relative of the\npolecat, but it is as yet unclear whether it is a domesticated form of the\nEuropean Polecat, the Steppe Polecat, or some hybrid of the two.\n\nThe history of the ferret's domestication is uncertain, like that of most other\ndomestic animals, but it is likely that ferrets have been domesticated for at\nleast 2,500 years. They are still used for hunting rabbits in some parts of\nthe world today, but increasingly they are kept simply as pets.\n\nBeing so closely related to polecats, ferrets are quite easily able to hybridize\nwith them, and this has occasionally resulted in feral colonies of polecat-\nferret hybrids that have been perceived to have caused damage to native fauna,\nperhaps most notably in New Zealand. As a result, some parts of the world have\nimposed restrictions on the keeping of ferrets.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"ferret","recorded":1376418373,"links":[],"instances":["animal","animal","biology","animal_behavior","ecology","region","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pet mammals","Ferrets","Animals bred for albinism on a large scale","Animals described in 1758","Feral animals"],"headings":["Biology","History of domestication","Ferrets as pets","Other uses of ferrets","Terminology and coloring","Regulation of ferrets as pets","Import restrictions","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["family","biology"],["spraying","animal_behavior"],["hybrid","biology"],["mole","animal"],["rabbit","ecology"],["burgundy","region"],["microchip_implant","animal"],["georgia","u.s._state"]],"members":["microchip_implant","mole","hybrid","spraying","rabbit","georgia","burgundy","family"],"related":["Animal","Chordate","Mammal","Carnivora","Mustelidae","Carl_Linnaeus","10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae","Domestication","Family_(biology)","Mustelidae","Sexual_dimorphism","Carnivor","Mammal","Endangered_species","Black-footed_Ferret","Polecat","European_Polecat","Steppe_Polecat","Polecat-ferret_hybrid","Oakland_Zoo","Crepuscular","Spraying_(animal_behavior)","Anal_gland","Weasel_war_dance","Obligate_carnivore","Cat_food","Rabbit","Incisor","Canine_tooth","Premolar","Adrenal_glands","Pancreas","Lymphoma_in_ferrets","Canine_distemper","Waardenburg_syndrome","European_polecat","Steppe_polecat","Mitochondrial_DNA","Hieroglyph","Aristophanes","Egyptian_Mongoose","Latin","Feral","Shetland_Islands","Melbourne,_Australia","Hybrid_(biology)","Weasels","Stoats","Rodent","Rabbit","Mole_(animal)","Caesar_Augustus","Pliny_the_Elder","Balearic_Islands","Rabbit_(ecology)","New_World","Influenza","Swine_flu","Cardiovascular_disease","Disease","Nutrition","SARS","Human_influenza","Animal_testing","Waardenburg_syndrome","Middle_Ages","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Stoat","Heraldry","Burgundy_(region)","Northern_Territory","Australian_Capital_Territory","Microchip_implant_(animal)","California","Puerto_Rico","Washington,_DC","Rhode_Island","Illinois","Georgia_(U.S._state)","Dallas,_Texas","Wisconsin","Common_Law","Strict_liability","Statutory_law","Canadian_Food_Inspection_Agency","Pet_passport","Canine_distemper","Ferret_legging","Stoats_in_New_Zealand","Ensembl"]}
