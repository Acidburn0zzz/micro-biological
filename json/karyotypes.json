{"cursor":"40999","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'karyotype' (Greek karyon = kernel, seed or nucleus) is the number and\nappearance of chromosomes in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. The term is also\nused for the complete set of chromosomes in a species, or an individual\norganism. Concise Oxford Dictionary\n\nKaryotypes describe the number of chromosomes, and what they look like under a\nlight microscope. Attention is paid to their length, the position of the\ncentromeres, banding pattern, any differences between the sex chromosomes, and\nany other physical characteristics. The preparation and study of\nkaryotypes is part of cytogenetics.\n\n staining]] The study of whole sets of chromosomes is sometimes known as\n karyology. The chromosomes are depicted (by rearranging a microphotograph) in a\n standard format known as a karyogram or idiogram: in pairs, ordered by size and\n position of centromere for chromosomes of the same size.\n\nThe basic number of chromosomes in the somatic cells of an individual or a\nspecies is called the somatic number and is designated 2n. Thus, in humans 2n =\n46. In the germ-line (the sex cells) the chromosome number is n (humans: n =\n23). p28\n\nSo, in normal diploid organisms, autosomal chromosomes are present in two\ncopies. There may, or may not, be sex chromosomes. Polyploid cells have multiple\ncopies of chromosomes and haploid cells have single copies.\n\nThe study of karyotypes is important for cell biology and genetics, and the\nresults may be used in evolutionary biology ([[systematics|karyosystematics]] http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Karyosystematics ) and\nmedicine. Karyotypes can be used for many purposes; such as to study chromosomal\naberrations, cellular function, taxonomic relationships, and to gather\ninformation about past evolutionary events.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"karyotypes","recorded":1376427559,"links":[],"instances":["biology","northwestern_hawaiian_islands","cellular","human","biology","genetics","genetics","human","human","biology","geology","genetics","human","human","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell
