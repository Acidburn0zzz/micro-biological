There are two\nspecific definitions in use.\n\n*In most cases filly is a female horse under the age of four years. *In some\nnations, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, the world of horse\nracing sets the cutoff age for fillies as younger than five\nyears. (Zenyatta was foaled in 2004, making her a 4-year-old at\nthe time.)\n\nThe equivalent term for a male is a colt. When horses of either sex are less\nthan one year of age, they are referred to as foals. Horses between\none and two years of age may also be called yearlings.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"filly","recorded":1376428079,"links":[],"instances":["horse","horse"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Types of horse","Female horses"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["colt","horse"],["yearling","horse"]],"members":["colt","yearling"],"related":["Female","Horse","Mare","Horse_racing","Colt_(horse)","Foal","Yearling_(horse)","Filly_Triple_Crown","Weanling"]}
