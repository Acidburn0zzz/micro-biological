It affects the pharynx\nincluding the tonsils and possibly the larynx. Common symptoms include fever,\nsore throat, and enlarged lymph nodes. It is the cause of 37% of sore throats\namong children and 5-15% in adults.\n\nStrep throat is a contagious infection, spread through close contact with an\ninfected individual. A definitive diagnosis is made based on the results of a\nthroat culture. However, this is not always needed as treatment may be decided\nbased on symptoms. In highly likely or confirmed cases, antibiotics are useful\nto both prevent complications and speed recovery.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Strep_throat","recorded":1376429004,"links":[],"instances":["test","tests","tests"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bacterial diseases","Human throat","Acute upper respiratory infections"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Cause","Diagnosis","Prevention","Treatment","Prognosis","Epidemiology","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["gold_standard","test"],["sensitivity","tests"],["specificity","tests"]],"members":["gold_standard","sensitivity","specificity"],"related":["Exudate","Pharyngitis","Group_A_streptococcal_infection","Pharynx","Tonsils","Larynx","Fever","Sore_throat","Lymph_nodes","Throat_culture","Antibiotics","Sore_throat","Fever","Pus","Tonsils","Cervical_lymph_nodes","Headache","Nausea","Vomiting","Abdominal_pain","Myalgia","Scarlatiniform_rash","Palatal_petechiae","Sensitivity_and_specificity","Incubation_period","Conjunctivitis","Exudate","Petechiae","Soft_palate","Sensitivity_and_specificity","Group_A_beta-hemolytic_streptococcus","Nonâ€“group_A_beta-hemolytic_streptococci","Fusobacterium","Pharyngitis","Empiric_antibiotics","Centor_criteria","Infectious_Disease_Society_of_America","Rheumatic_fever","Throat_culture","Gold_standard_(test)","Rapid_strep_test","Sensitivity_(tests)","Specificity_(tests)","Diarrhea","Conjunctivitis","Viral_sore_throat","Infectious_mononucleosis","Tonsillectomy","Rheumatic_fever","Retropharyngeal_abscess","Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug","Paracetamol","Lidocaine","Steroids","Reye's_syndrome","Phenoxymethylpenicillin","Amoxicillin","Benzathine_penicillin","Rheumatic_fever","Peritonsillar_abscess","Erythromycin","Macrolides","Clindamycin","Penicillin_allergy","Cephalosporins","Acute_glomerulonephritis","Rheumatic_fever","Scarlet_fever","Toxic_shock_syndrome","Glomerulonephritis","PANDAS","Peritonsillar_abscess","Cervical_lymphadenitis","Mastoiditis","Pharyngitis"]}
