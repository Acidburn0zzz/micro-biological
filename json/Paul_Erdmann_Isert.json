{"cursor":"6059","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Paul Erdmann Isert' (1756 â 21 January 1789) was a German botanist. Isert was\nborn in AngermÃ¼nde/Brandenburg, but educated in [Berlin]. He was the first\nscientist to identify the bird Red Bishop (Euplectes orix franciscana (Isert)'.\nHe is also known for his attempts to end the Danish-Norwegian slave trade.\n\nHe was appointed Chief Surgeon to Christiansborg (Osu, Accra) in Danish Guinea,\narriving there in 1783. He sought this position because of his burning desire to\ncollect plant specimens from West Africa. Once there, realizing that the\ninhabitants had no written language, he felt it his duty to record â for future\ngenerations â details of all aspects of life on the Gold Coast, as he observed\nthem, thus creating an ethnographic, as well as botanical, work.\n\nAfter nearly three years on the Gold Coast Isert abruptly determined to leave\nthe country on the first possible ship back to Europe. This was due to his\nextreme frustration at being hindered from exploring in Ashanti. It was on this\nship, a slave ship en route from Danish Guinea, on the second day at sea, that\nhe witnessed a slave rebellion on the open sea, which almost cost him his life.\nThe cargo of 452 blacks rose against the whites, with a resulting loss of 34 of\ntheir number and 2 of the crew wounded after a heated battle. In the West\nIndies, he visited Saint Croix, Saint. Thomas, Saint John, Guadeloupe and\nMartinique. Sickened by the horror and human misery he saw, both in the slave-\nprocessing dungeons of Christiansborg, aboard the ship, and on the sugar\nplantations, Isert came up with an alternative to the abhorrent practice of the\ntransatlantic slave trade. He found it not only inhumane, cruel and immoral, but\nalso absurdly stupid. In a letter sent from Saint Croix in 1787 to his father,\nIsert asked questions:\n\n:Why were our forefathers not sensible enough to establish plantations right\nthere in the fertile continent of Africa; plantations for sugar, coffee, cacao,\ncotton and other articles that had become so necessary in Europe?\n\n:\"...if we had come to them with an olive branch in our hand instead of\n:murderous steel, the natives would willingly have given us access to the best\n:and most fertile parts of their lands, areas which for untold years had been\n:lying desolate.\"\n\nThese African people would have helped us in freedom and, for low wages would\nhave given us greatness and riches with no offense against nature, or our\npersonal and national consciences.\n\nWhy did we have to uproot vast numbers of people from their homelands, subject\nthem to agony, torture, humiliation, and death; transplant them to alien\ncontinents, Caribbean islands, big and small? Why?\n\nIsert wanted to demonstrate that the establishment of working plantations on the\ncontinent of Africa could be practical and profitable. To this end, he enlisted\nthe aid of Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann, who was then the Danish-Norwegian\nMinister of Finance. Schimmelmann, a well-known and well-off liberal, who was\ninstrumental in the passage of the law ending the Danish-Norwegian transatlantic\nslave trade, agreed to finance Isert's endeavour.\n\nIn 1788, Isert published his famous book Reise nach Guinea und den CaribÃ¤ischen\nInseln in Columbia (Journey to Guinea and the Caribbean Islands in Columbia),\nwherein he described his experiences with, and his views on, the slave trade.\nLater in the summer, he sailed for Africa and established a crown plantation,\nFrederiksnopel, near Akropong in the fertile and cool Akwapim Hills reminiscent\nof the Mediterranean, purchasing the land from the Akwapim chief, Nana Obuobi\nAtiemo, on behalf of the King Christian VII of Denmark. Isert and Nana Obuobi\nAtiemo had been comrades-in-arms during a war in 1783, waged at the Volta River,\nand had evidently formed a lasting friendship. With the help of Nana Obuobi\nAtiemo, who shared Isert's enthusiasm about the plan, paid African workers and\nthe European group that had accompanied Isert, cleared the land and planted only\neasily cultivated plants, for their own sustenance. Trade products, such as\nsugar and cotton, would be put off until later.\n\nOn 16 January 1789, Isert wrote a report to the King of Denmark in which he\nexpressed the fine initial success that he was enjoying. Isert died on 21\nJanuary 1789, just five days after writing the report. It was believed that\nIsert had died from a tropical fever. His wife, Dorothea Elisabeth Plum died a\nshort time after the birth of their child, a daughter, who also died, a month\nlater, on 8 March. Isert's assistants attempted to carry on the project at\nFrederiksnopel, as did some others, but it failed due to various factors; such\nas distance from the sea, lack of support, and competition from Christiansborg.\n\nConvinced of the feasibility of the plantations, an edict was issued in the name\nof King Christian VII by his son Prince Frederick (who was then Regent because\nof his father's mental illness) on 16 March 1792, which came into effect on 1\nJanuary 1803. Denmark-Norway thus bears the honour of being the first\nestablished sovereign state to prohibit the transatlantic slave trade. But\nultimately, the experimental plantations proved to be unsuccessful.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Paul_Erdmann_Isert","recorded":1376425452,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Paul_Erdmann_Isert&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Paul_Erdmann_Isert&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erdmann_Isert","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Botanist","/w/index.php?title=Angerm%C3%BCnde/Brandenburg&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Denmark-Norway","/wiki/Slavery","/wiki/Danish_Guinea","/wiki/Saint_Croix","/wiki/Saint_Thomas,_United_States_Virgin_Islands","/wiki/Saint_John,_United_States_Virgin_Islands","/wiki/Martinique","/wiki/Ernst_Heinrich_von_Schimmelmann","/wiki/Akropong","/w/index.php?title=Akwapim&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Nana_Obuobi_Atiemo&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Christian_VII_of_Denmark","/wiki/Frederick_VI_of_Denmark","/w/index.php?title=Paul_Erdmann_Isert&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Paul_Erdmann_Isert&veaction=edit&section=1","http://mertzdigital.nybg.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p9016coll23/id/4911/rec/44","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/14807486","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Erdmann_Isert&oldid=541147546","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1756_births","/wiki/Category:1789_deaths","/wiki/Category:German_botanists","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_June_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Paul+Erdmann+Isert&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Paul+Erdmann+Isert","/wiki/Paul_Erdmann_Isert","/wiki/Talk:Paul_Erdmann_Isert","#","/wiki/Paul_Erdmann_Isert","/w/index.php?title=Paul_Erdmann_Isert&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Paul_Erdmann_Isert&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Paul_Erdmann_Isert&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Paul_Erdmann_Isert","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Paul_Erdmann_Isert","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Paul_Erdmann_Isert&oldid=541147546","/w/index.php?title=Paul_Erdmann_Isert&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q67873","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Paul_Erdmann_Isert&id=541147546","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Paul+Erdmann+Isert","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Paul+Erdmann+Isert&oldid=541147546&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Paul_Erdmann_Isert&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erdmann_Isert","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erdmann_Isert","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erdmann_Isert","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D0%B7%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82,_%D0%9F%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8C_%D0%AD%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erdmann_Isert","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q67873#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erdmann_Isert","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/st
