{"cursor":"3779","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'spatula' is a small implement with a broad, flat, flexible blade used to mix,\nspread and lift materials including foods, drugs, plaster and paints. It derives\nfrom the Latin word for a flat piece of wood or splint (a diminutive form of the\nLatin [[spatha]], meaning broadsword), and hence can also refer to a tongue\ndepressor. The words spade (digging tool) and spathe are similarly derived. The\nword spatula is known to have been used in English since 1525.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"spatula","recorded":1376427895,"links":[],"instances":["kitchen","tool","film","kitchen_utensil","cut"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cooking utensils","Domestic implements"],"headings":["Design","In the kitchen","Laboratory use","Trivia","Related utensils","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["fillet","cut"],["scraper","kitchen"],["fish_slice","kitchen_utensil"],["uhf","film"],["peel","tool"],["scraper","kitchen"]],"members":["scraper","peel","uhf","fish_slice","fillet"],"related":["Tongue_depressor","Spade","Spathe","Right-handed","Left-handed","Kitchen","Pancakes","Fillet_(cut)","Plastic","Heat","Frosting_spatula","Palette_knife","Scraper_(kitchen)","British_English","Fish_slice_(kitchen_utensil)","\"Weird_Al\"_Yankovic","UHF_(film)","Outlet_store","Christmas","Peel_(tool)","Putty_knife","Scraper_(kitchen)","Scoopula"]}
