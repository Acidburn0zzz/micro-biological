Beta receptors are found on cells of the\nheart muscles, smooth muscles, airways, arteries, kidneys, and other tissues\nthat are part of the sympathetic nervous system and lead to stress responses,\nespecially when they are stimulated by epinephrine (adrenaline). Beta blockers\ninterfere with the binding to the receptor of epinephrine and other stress\nhormones, and weaken the effects of stress hormones.\n\nThey are particularly used for the management of cardiac arrhythmias, protecting\nthe heart from a second heart attack (myocardial infarction) after a first heart\nattack (secondary prevention), and\nhypertension.\n\nIn 1962, Sir James W. Black  found the first clinically significant beta\nblockersâpropranolol and pronethalol; it revolutionized the medical management\nof angina pectoris and is considered by many to\nbe one of the most important contributions to clinical medicine and pharmacology\nof the 20th century.\n\nBeta blockers block the action of endogenous catecholamines epinephrine\n(adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) in particular, on Î²-adrenergic\nreceptors, part of the sympathetic nervous system, which mediates the fight-or-\nflight response. {{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=y3R1Vd3NHqcC&pg=PA152&dq=mo-\nde+of+action+of+beta+blockers#v=onepage&q=mode%20of%20action%20of%20beta%20bloc-\nkers&f=false|title=Current Cardiovascular Drugs |author= Frishman\nW.H.|coauthors= Cheng-Lai A, Nawarskas J |year= 2005 |publisher= Current Science\nGroup |pages= 152 |accessdate=2010-09-07 |isbn=978-1-57340-221-7}} {{Cite book |url-\n=http://books.google.com/?id=EaP1yJz4fkEC&pg=PA205&dq=beta+receptors+heart+kidn-\neys#v=onepage&q=beta%20receptors%20heart%20kidneys&f=false|title=Pharmacotherap-\neutics for advanced practice: a practical approach|author= Arcangelo\nV.P.|coauthors= Peterson A.M.|year= 2006|publisher= Lippincott Williams &\nWilkins|pages= 205|accessdate=2010-09-07 |isbn=978-0-7817-5784-3}} Three\ntypes of beta receptors are known, designated Î² 1, Î² 2 and\nÎ² 3 receptors. Î² 1-adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the heart\nand in the kidneys. Î² 2-adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the lungs,\ngastrointestinal tract, liver, uterus, vascular smooth muscle, and skeletal\nmuscle. Î² 3-\nadrenergic receptors are located in fat cells.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Î²-adrenergic_blockers","recorded":1376428637,"links":[],"instances":["medical","anatomy","cardiac","performing_arts"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Beta blockers|","Scottish inventions"],"headings":["Medical uses","Adverse effects","β-Receptor antagonism","Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity","α<sub>1</sub>-Receptor antagonism","Other effects","Examples","Comparative information","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["audition","performing_arts"],["fatigue","medical"],["atrium","anatomy"],["refractory_period","cardiac"]],"members":["fatigue","atrium","refractory_period","audition"],"related":["Hypertension","Arrhythmia","Skeletal_formula","Propranolol","Receptor_antagonists","Medication","Beta_receptor","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Epinephrine","Cardiac_arrhythmia","Myocardial_infarction","Hypertension","James_W._Black","Propranolol","Pronethalol","Angina_pectoris","Pharmacology","Endogenous","Catecholamine","Norepinephrine","Adrenergic_receptor","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Fight-or-flight_response","Beta-1_adrenergic_receptor","Beta-2_adrenergic_receptor","Beta-3_adrenergic_receptor","Angina_pectoris","Atrial_fibrillation","Cardiac_arrhythmia","Congestive_heart_failure","Essential_tremor","Glaucoma","Hypertension","Migraine","Prophylaxis","Mitral_valve_prolapse","Myocardial_infarction","Phaeochromocytoma","Alpha_blocker","Postural_orthostatic_tachycardia_syndrome","Tachycardia","Tremor","Anxiety","Hyperthyroidism","Theophylline","Aortic_dissection","Cardiomyopathy","Marfan_syndrome","Propranolol","Portal_hypertension","Hyperhidrosis","Social_anxiety_disorder","Anxiety_disorders","Congestive_heart_failure","Bisoprolol","Carvedilol","Metoprolol","ACE_inhibitor","Diuretic","Anxiolytic","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Anxiety_disorders","Fight-or-flight","Musicians","Public_speaker","Actors","Dancers","Performance_anxiety","Stage_fright","Audition_(performing_arts)","International_Conference_of_Symphony_Orchestra_Musicians","United_States","Target_archery","Shooting_sports","Golf","Snooker","International_Olympic_Committee","2008_Summer_Olympics","Shooting_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics_–_Men's_50_metre_pistol","Shooting_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics_–_Men's_10_metre_air_pistol","Kim_Jong-su","Propranolol","Stutterer","Surgeon","Adverse_drug_reaction","Nausea","Diarrhea","Bronchospasm","Dyspnea","Raynaud's_syndrome","Bradycardia","Hypotension","Heart_failure","Heart_block","Fatigue_(medical)","Dizziness","Alopecia","Hallucinations","Insomnia","Sexual_dysfunction","Erectile_dysfunction","Glucose","Lipid","Metabolism","Orthostatic_hypotension","Carvedilol","Edema","Blood–brain_barrier","Propranolol","Metoprolol","Aldosterone","Hyponatremia","Hyperkalemia","Hypoglycemia","Diabetes","ACE_inhibitors","Angiotensin_II_receptor_antagonist","Cocaine","Amphetamine","Stimulant","Overdose","Hypertension","Ventricular_function","Cardiac_output","Antihypertensive","Vasodilators","Nitroglycerin","Diuretics","Furosemide","Alpha_blockers","Phentolamine","Glucagon","Ipratropium","Salbutamol","Isoprenaline","Epinephrine","Norepinephrine","Chronotropic","Inotropic","Renin","Smooth_muscle","Skeletal_muscle","Glycogenolysis","Liver","Skeletal_muscle","Lipolysis","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Antihypertensive","Renin","Central_nervous_system","Chronotropic","Sinus_node","Atrioventricular_node","Atrium_(anatomy)","Refractory_period_(cardiac)","Sotalol","Action_potential","Potassium_channel","Renin-angiotensin_system","Norepinephrine","Partial_agonist","Oxprenolol","Pindolol","Penbutolol","Acebutolol","Receptor_agonist","Receptor_antagonist","Bradycardia","Myocardial_infarction","Angina_pectoris","Tachyarrhythmia","Labetalol","Carvedilol","Adrenergic_receptor","Arteriole","Melatonin","Intraocular_pressure","Alprenolol","Bucindolol","Carteolol","Carvedilol","Labetalol","Nadolol","Oxprenolol","Penbutolol","Pindolol","Propranolol","Sotalol","Timolol","Eucommia","Acebutolol","Sympathomimetic_drug","Atenolol","Betaxolol","Bisoprolol","Celiprolol","Esmolol","Metoprolol","Nebivolol","Butaxamine","ICI-118,551","SR_59230A","Membrane_stabilizing_effect","Esmolol","Sotalol","Landiolol","Carvedilol","Metoprolol","Betaxolol","Carteolol","Levobunolol","Metipranolol","Timolol","Atenolol","Metoprolol","Propranolol","Timolol","Propranolol","Propranolol","Phaeochromocytoma","Alpha_blockers"]}
