On\nAugust 21, 1972, it was accepted into service and would later be exported to the\nWarsaw Pact and other allies. Introduced as a successor to the earlier BTR-60,\nit most closely resembles a BTR-60PB. Other improvements include heavier armor\nplating and tires less prone to puncture. In other respects, the vehicle is very\nsimilar to the BTR-60PB, with a more powerful petrol engine configuration and\narmament of a primary heavy machine gun and secondary PKT machine gun on a roof\nmounted turret.\n\nThe vehicle's designers moved the side troop doors. On the vehicle's\npredecessor, these doors were located above the beltline between the second and\nthird pairs of wheels on both sides of the vehicle. On the BTR-70, the doors are\nbelow the beltline between the second and third pairs of wheels. As Soviet\ntactics calls for unloading troops from the vehicle while it is in motion, the\ndoor location increases the chances that a soldier will be pulled under a wheel\nand injured or killed, although it also means that the troops can get out\nquicker while exposing them less to the enemy.\n\nLike the vehicle's predecessor it is fully amphibious with minimal preparation.\nA licensed Romanian copy was designated the TAB-77 and had various improvements\nand changes to make local production easier, including a better turret and\ndifferent engines.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"BTR-70","recorded":1376429299,"links":[],"instances":["armoured_personnel_carrier","military"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Armoured personnel carriers of the Soviet Union","Armoured personnel carriers of the Cold War","Cold War armoured fighting vehicles of the Soviet Union","GAZ","Wheeled amphibious vehicles","Amphibious armoured personnel carriers","Military vehicles 1970–1979"],"headings":["Equipment","Variants","Combat history","Operators","Notes","References","External links","See also"],"image":[],"tags":[["tab","armoured_personnel_carrier"],["command_and_control","military"]],"members":["tab","command_and_control"],"related":["Armoured_personnel_carrier","KPV_heavy_machine_gun","DShK_heavy_machine_gun","PK_machine_gun","Armored_personnel_carrier","Warsaw_Pact","BTR-60","Vehicle_armour","Machine_gun","PKT","Amphibious_vehicle","TAB_(armoured_personnel_carrier)","KPVT","PKT","9K38_Igla","Strela-3","MANPADS","AGS-17","Proximity_fuze","Command_and_Control_(Military)","KPV","ATGM","TABC-79","Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan","Eastern_Europe","Cold_War","Armoured_fighting_vehicle","UN","BTR-80","Pakistan_Army","BTR-60","BTR-80","BTR-90","BTR-94"]}
