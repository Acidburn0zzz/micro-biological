While a pupil at the gymnasium he pursued\nbotany and mineralogy in his leisure time, till in 1823 he entered the\nUniversity of TÃ¼bingen. After graduating with distinction in medicine he went\nto Munich, where he met a distinguished circle of botanists, and found ample\nmaterial for research.\n\nThis seems to have determined his career as a botanist, and he started in 1828\nthose anatomical investigations which continued till his death. In 1832 he was\nappointed professor of botany in TÃ¼bingen, a post which he never left.\nUnmarried, his pleasures were in his laboratory and library, and in perfecting\noptical apparatus and microscopic preparations, for which he showed\nextraordinary manual skill. He was largely a self-taught botanist from\nboyhood, and, little influenced in his opinions even by his teachers,\npreserved always his independence of view on scientific questions. He received\nmany honours during his lifetime, and was elected foreign fellow of the Royal\nSociety in 1868.\n\nMohl's writings cover a period of forty-four years; the most notable of them\nwere republished in 1845 in a volume entitled Vermischte Schriften (For lists of\nhis works see Botanische Zeitung, 1872, p. 576, and Royal Soc. Catalogue, 1870,\nvol. iv.) They dealt with a variety of subjects, but chiefly with the structure\nof the higher forms, including both rough anatomy and minute histology. The word\nprotoplasm was his suggestion; the nucleus had already been recognized by R.\nBrown and others; but Mohl showed in 1844 that the protoplasm is the source of\nthose movements which at that time excited so much attention.\n\nHe recognized under the name of primordial utricle the protoplasmic lining of\nthe vacuolated cell, and first described the behaviour of the protoplasm in cell\ndivision. These and other observations led to the overthrow of Schleiden's\ntheory of origin of cells by free-cell-formation. His contributions to knowledge\nof the cell-wall were no less remarkable; he held the view now generally adopted\nof growth of cell-wall by apposition. He first explained the true nature of\npits, and showed the cellular origin of vessels and of fibrous cells; he was, in\nfact, the true founder of the cell theory. Clearly the author of such researches\nwas the man to collect into one volume the theory of cell-formation, and this he\ndid in his treatise Die vegetabilische Zelle (1851), a short work translated\ninto English (Ray Society, 1852).\n\nMohl's early investigations on the structure of palms, of cycads, and of tree\nferns permanently laid the foundation of all later knowledge of this subject: so\nalso his work on [[Isoetes]] (1840). His later anatomical work was chiefly on\nthe stems of dicotyledons and gymnosperms; in his observations on cork and bark\nhe first explained the formation and origin of different types of bark, and\ncorrected errors relating to lenticels. Following on his early demonstration of\nthe origin of stomata (1838), he wrote a classical paper on their opening and\nclosing (1850).\n\nIn 1843 he started the weekly Botanische Zeitung in conjunction with\nSchlechtendal, which he edited jointly till his death. He was never a great\nwriter of comprehensive works; no text-book exists in his name, and it would\nindeed appear from his withdrawal from co-operation in Hofmeister's Handbuch\nthat he had a distaste for such efforts. In 1850, he was elected a foreign\nmember of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In his latter years his\nproductive activity fell off, doubtless through failing health, and he died\nsuddenly at TÃ¼bingen on 1 April 1872.\n","linknr":150,"url":"Hugo_von_Mohl","recorded":1376425343,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Hugo_von_Mohl&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hugo_von_Mohl&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_von_Mohl","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Hugo_von_mohl.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Hugo_von_mohl.jpg/220px-Hugo_von_mohl.jpg","/wiki/Stuttgart","/wiki/T%C3%BCbingen","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Botany","/wiki/Author_citation_(botany)","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Botanist","/wiki/Stuttgart","/wiki/W%C3%BCrttemberg","/w/index.php?title=Benjamin_Ferdinand_von_Mohl&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/University_of_T%C3%BCbingen","/wiki/Royal_Society","/wiki/Histology","/wiki/Protoplasm","/wiki/Robert_Brown_(botanist)","/wiki/Matthias_Jakob_Schleiden","/wiki/Cycad","/wiki/Tree_fern","/wiki/Isoetes","/wiki/Dicotyledon","/wiki/Gymnosperm","/wiki/Bark","/wiki/Stomata","/wiki/Diederich_Franz_Leonhard_von_Schlechtendal","/wiki/Wilhelm_Friedrich_Benedikt_Hofmeister","/wiki/Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences","/wiki/T%C3%BCbingen","/wiki/List_of_botanists_by_author_abbreviation","/wiki/Author_citation_(botany)","/wiki/Botanical_name","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Hugo_von_Mohl&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Hugo_von_Mohl&veaction=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Hugo_von_Mohl","#cite_ref-1","http://www.ipni.org/ipni/advAuthorSearch.do?find_abbreviation=Mohl","/wiki/International_Plant_Names_Index","/wiki/Julius_von_Sachs","http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/16271#page/310/mode/1up","/wiki/Biodiversity_Heritage_Library","/wiki/Anton_de_Bary","http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/101653#page/323/mode/1up","/wiki/Proc._Roy._Soc.","/wiki/Allgemeine_Deutsche_Biographie","/wiki/File:PD-icon.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/44415429","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hugo_von_Mohl&oldid=561136328","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Botanists_with_author_abbreviations","/wiki/Category:1805_births","/wiki/Category:1872_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Stuttgart","/wiki/Category:People_from_the_Kingdom_of_W%C3%BCrttemberg","/wiki/Category:German_botanists","/wiki/Category:Bryologists","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences","/wiki/Category:Foreign_Members_of_the_Royal_Society","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Bavarian_Maximilian_Order_for_Science_and_Art","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_with_no_article_parameter","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_the_1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Hugo+von+Mohl&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Hugo+von+Mohl","/wiki/Hugo_von_Mohl","/wiki/Talk:Hugo_von_Mohl","#","/wiki/Hugo_von_Mohl","/w/index.php?title=Hugo_von_Mohl&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hugo_von_Mohl&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hugo_von_Mohl&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wik
