{"cursor":"24993","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'castrato' (Italian, plural: castrati) is a type of classical male singing\nvoice equivalent to that of a soprano, mezzo-soprano, or contralto. The voice is\nproduced by castration of the singer before puberty, or it occurs in one who,\ndue to an endocrinological condition, never reaches sexual maturity.\n\nCastration before puberty (or in its early stages) prevents a boy's larynx from\nbeing transformed by the normal physiological events of puberty. As a result,\nthe vocal range of prepubescence (shared by both sexes) is largely retained, and\nthe voice develops into adulthood in a unique way. Prepubescent castration for\nthis purpose diminished greatly in the late 18th century and was made illegal in\nItaly in 1870.\n\nAs the castrato's body grew, his lack of testosterone meant that his epiphyses\n(bone-joints) did not harden in the normal manner. Thus the limbs of the\ncastrati often grew unusually long, as did the bones of their ribs. This,\ncombined with intensive training, gave them unrivalled lung-power and breath capacity.

Operating through small, child-sized vocal cords, their voices were\nalso extraordinarily flexible, and quite different from the equivalent adult\nfemale voice. Their vocal range was higher than that of the uncastrated adult\nmale (see soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, sopranist, countertenor and contralto).\nListening to the only surviving recordings of a castrato (see below), one can\nhear that the lower part of the voice sounds like a \"super-high\" tenor, with a\nmore falsetto-like upper register above that.\n\nCastrati were rarely referred to as such: in the 18th century, the euphemism\n[[musico]] (pl musici) was much more generally used, although it usually carried\nderogatory implications; New Grove Dictionary of Opera, vol 3, p.529, sv\n\"musico\" another synonym was evirato (literally meaning \"emasculated\").\nEunuch is a more general term, since historically many eunuchs were castrated\nafter puberty, castration thus having no effect on their voices.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"castrato","recorded":1376428432,"links":[],"instances":["voice","castrato","court_official","anatomy","film","castrato"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Voice types","Castrati|*","Opera history","Opera terminology","Italian words and phrases","Obsolete occupations","Androgyny"],"headings":["History","European classical tradition","Opera","Decline","Modern castrati and similar voices","Notable castrati","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["limb","anatomy"],["alto","voice"],["eunuch","court_official"],["giovanni_velluti","castrato"],["caffarelli","castrato"],["giovanni_velluti","castrato"],["farinelli","film"]],"members":["alto","caffarelli","eunuch","limb","farinelli","giovanni_velluti"],"related":["Voice_type","Classical_music","Singing","Human_voice","Soprano","Mezzo-soprano","Contralto","Castration","Puberty","Endocrinology","Sexual_maturity","Larynx","Voice_cracking","Vocal_range","Epiphyses","Limb_(anatomy)","Rib","Lung_capacity","Vocal_cords","Soprano","Mezzo-soprano","Alto_(voice)","Sopranist","Countertenor","Contralto","Falsetto","Euphemism","New_Grove_Dictionary_of_Opera","Emasculated","Eunuch","Sumer","Eunuch","Eunuch","Byzantine_Empire","Constantinople","Aelia_Eudoxia","Hagia_Sophia","Fourth_Crusade","Muslim","Eunuch_(court_official)","Ippolito_II_d'Este","Guglielmo_I_Gonzaga","Alfonso_II,_Duke_of_Ferrara","Sistine_Chapel","Palencia","Orléans","Normandy","Munich","Kapellmeister","Orlando_di_Lasso","Pope_Sixtus_V","St_Peter's,_Rome","Monteverdi","Farinelli","Senesino","Gasparo_Pacchierotti","Charles_Burney","Senesino","Casanova","Italy","Prima_donna","Gaspare_Pacchierotti","Crescentini","Giovanni_Velluti_(castrato)","Giacomo_Meyerbeer","Gilbert-Louis_Duprez","Enrico_Tamberlik","Jean_de_Reszke","Francesco_Tamagno","Enrico_Caruso","Giovanni_Martinelli","Beniamino_Gigli","Jussi_Björling","Franco_Corelli","Luciano_Pavarotti","Pope_Leo_XIII","Alessandro_Moreschi","Pope_Benedict_XIV","Lorenzo_Perosi","Double-bass","Hormone","Kallmann's_syndrome","Jimmy_Scott","Radu_Marian","Michael_Maniaci","Falsetto","Countertenor","Aris_Christofellis","Leonardo_Leo","Carlo_Broschi","Jazz","Jimmy_Scott","Blues","Cem_Adrian","Chris_Colfer","Jeff_Buckley","Girolamo_Bacchini","Loreto_Vittori","Baldassare_Ferri","Atto_Melani","Giovanni_Francesco_Grossi","Pier_Francesco_Tosi","Matteo_Sassano","Nicolò_Grimaldi","Antonio_Bernacchi","Senesino","Valentino_Urbani","Giovanni_Carestini","Farinelli","Domenico_Annibali","Caffarelli_(castrato)","Felice_Salimbeni","Giaocchino_Conti","Mariano_Nicolini","Giovanni_Manzuoli","Gaetano_Guadagni","Antoine_Albanèse","Silvio_Giorgetti","Giusto_Fernando_Tenducci","Gasparo_Pacchierotti","Venanzio_Rauzzini","Luigi_Marchesi","Vincenzo_dal_Prato","Girolamo_Crescentini","Giovanni_Velluti_(castrato)","Domenico_Mustafà","Domenico_Salvatori","Alessandro_Moreschi","Eunuch","Farinelli_(film)","Antonio_Maria_Bononcini","Radu_Marian"]}
