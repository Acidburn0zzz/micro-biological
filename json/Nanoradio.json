Currently only receivers have been developed and they are structured\naround a carbon nanotube. The first such device was described in October 2007 by\na team led by physicist Alex Zettl. {{cite journal\n  | first = Kevin last = Bullis title = TR10: NanoRadio journal = Technology\n  | Review publisher = MIT Technology Review, Inc location = Cambridge date =\n  | 2008-02-25 url = http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=20244\n  | accessdate = 2008-02-27}}\n\nThe nanotube, about 10 nanometers in diameter and several hundred nanometers\nlong, is contained in a vacuum and one of its ends is connected to an electrode\nof a battery. The other electrode is placed a short distance from the nanotube's\nother end. The tube, now charged, will vibrate in tune with any external\nelectromagnetic signal, effectively acting as an antenna. The favorable\nvibration frequency can be adjusted by changing the applied voltage, which to\ntune the radio to different carrier frequencies. The field electron emission\neffect causes a current to flow, as electrons tunnel across the gap between the\ntube and the second electrode. This current represents an amplified version of\nthe radio signal; no demodulation is necessary.
