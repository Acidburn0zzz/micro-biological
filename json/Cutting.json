{"cursor":"2787","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n - sewing (left), paper (middle), kitchen (right)]] 'Cutting' is the separation\n   of a physical object, or a portion of a physical object, into two or more\n   portions, through the application of an acutely directed force. Implements\n   commonly used for cutting are the knife and saw, or in medicine and science\n   the scalpel and microtome. However, any sufficiently sharp object is capable\n   of cutting if it has a hardness sufficiently larger than the object being\n   cut, and if it is applied with sufficient force. Even liquids can be used to\n   cut things when applied with sufficient force (see water jet cutter).\n\nCutting is a compressive and shearing phenomenon, and occurs only when the total\nstress generated by the cutting implement exceeds the ultimate strength of the\nmaterial of the object being cut. The simplest applicable equation is stress =\nforce/area: The stress generated by a cutting implement is directly proportional\nto the force with which it is applied, and inversely proportional to the area of\ncontact. Hence, the smaller the area (i.e., the sharper the cutting implement),\nthe less force is needed to cut something.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Cutting","recorded":1376427885,"links":[],"instances":["physics","physical","anatomy","tool","machining","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cutting|","Cutting tools|"],"headings":["Tools commonly used for cutting","See also","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["compression","physical"],["shearing","physics"],["stress","physics"],["cutting_tool","machining"],["nail","anatomy"],["file","tool"]],"members":["stress","compression","nail","file","cutting_tool","shearing"],"related":["Force","Knife","Saw","Scalpel","Microtome","Hardness","Water_jet_cutter","Compression_(physical)","Shearing_(physics)","Stress_(physics)","Strength_of_materials","Abrasive_saw","Axe","Blade","Bandsaw","Chainsaw","Circular_saw","Cutting_tool_(machining)","Diamond_blade","Diamond_tool","Drill_bit","Nail_(anatomy)","File_(tool)","Front_teeth","Glass_cutter","Grater","Hacksaw","Hand_saw","Hole_saw","Knife","Laser_cutting","Lawn_Mower","Machete","Meat_slicer","Mezzaluna","Milling_cutter","Miter_saw","Nail_clipper","Nibbler","Pizza_cutter","Plasma_cutter","Razor","Saw","Scalpel","Scissors","Switchblade","Sword","Tool_bit","Water_jet_cutter","Tearing","Machining"]}
