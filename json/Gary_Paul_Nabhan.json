He is considered a pioneer in the local food movement and the\nheirloom seed saving movement.\n\nA first generation Lebanese-American, Nabhan was raised in Gary, Indiana. He\nserved as Director of Science at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum and co-founded\nNative Seeds/SEARCH, a nonprofit conservation organization that works to\npreserve indigenous southwestern agricultural plants as well as knowledge of\ntheir uses. Nabhan was the founding director of the Center for Sustainable\nEnvironments at Northern Arizona University. In 2008 he joined the University of\nArizona faculty as a Research Social Scientist with the Southwest Center, where\nhe now serves as the Kellogg Endowed Chair in Southwestern Borderlands Food and\nWater Security.\n\nNabhan won the John Burroughs Medal for distinguished natural history writing.\nHe was also the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship. He was named an [[Utne\nReader]] visionary in 2011. He has also been honored\nwith two honorary PhD.s, and lifetime achievement awards from the Society for\nConservation Biology, the Quivira Coalition, the Chefs Collaborative, Edible\nCommunities and the Western Parks Association.\n\nThe unifying theme of Nabhan's work is how to avert the impoverishment and\nendangerment of ecological and cultural relationships,while celebrating the\ntraditional ecological knowledge of the agrarian communities. He has played a\ncatalytic role in the multicultural, collaborative conservation movement, being\none of the co-authors of its populist manifesto, \"An Invitation to Join the\nRadical Center\". Nabhan, Gary Paul, and 19 ohers (February\n2003).\n\"[http://www.awestthatworks.com/2Essays/Radical_Center/Radical_Center.pdf An\nInvitation to Join the Radical Center]\". A West That Works website. Retrieved 3\nMarch 2013. Nabhan was among the first creative non-fiction writers to\nlink the loss of biodiversity to the loss of cultural diversity. In his book\nwith Stephen Trimble, The Geography of Childhood, he was among the first\npopular writers to show concern with the loss of children's access to the\nnatural world. He has been a significant contributor in calling attention to\nthe environmental issue of pollinator decline. He founded the Forgotten\nPollinators Campaign, the Migratory Pollinators Conservation Initiative, and\nnow attempts to restore nectar corridors for pollinators in bi-national\nwatersheds around his home in Patagonia, Arizona, which he calls the\n\"pollinator diversity capitol of the United States.\" In addition to the\narticles and books on pollination ecology for which he has been sole author or\neditor, he co-authored with Stephen L. Buchmann one of the key works on the\ntopic - The Forgotten Pollinators from Island Press (1996).\n\nNabhan farms a diverse set of heirloom fruit and nut varieties from the Spanish\nMission era and from the Middle Eastern homelands of his ancestors, as well as\nheritage grains and beans adapted to arid climates. He is a champion of water\nharvesting, which he implements in his own orchard and gardens, and he has\nwritten introductions on this topic in permaculture books by Bill Mollison and\nBrad Lancaster.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Gary_Paul_Nabhan","recorded":1376425300,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Gary_Paul_Nabhan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gary_Paul_Nabhan&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Paul_Nabhan","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Gary,_Indiana","/wiki/Ecology","/wiki/Ethnobotany","/wiki/Native_Seeds/SEARCH","/w/index.php?title=Sabores_Sin_Fronteras&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Arizona-Sonora_Desert_Museum","/wiki/Northern_Arizona_University","/wiki/University_of_Arizona","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/Prescott_College","/wiki/University_of_Arizona","/w/index.php?title=Pollinator_Decline&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Local_foods","/wiki/Seed_saving","/w/index.php?title=Collaborative_conservation&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/John_Burroughs_Medal","/wiki/MacArthur_Fellowship","/w/index.php?title=Southwest_Book_Award&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Lannan_Literary_Award","/w/index.php?title=Kellogg_Endowed_Chair&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Ethnobotanist","/wiki/Southwestern_United_States","/wiki/Gary,_Indiana","/wiki/Arizona-Sonora_Desert_Museum","/wiki/Native_Seeds/SEARCH","/wiki/Endemic_(ecology)","/wiki/Northern_Arizona_University","/wiki/University_of_Arizona","/wiki/John_Burroughs_Medal","/wiki/MacArthur_Fellowship","/wiki/Utne_Reader","#cite_note-visionary-1","#cite_note-Nabhan-2","/wiki/Pollinator_decline","/w/index.php?title=Gary_Paul_Nabhan&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Gary_Paul_Nabhan&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9781597263993","/w/index.php?title=Gary_Paul_Nabhan&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Gary_Paul_Nabhan&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-visionary_1-0","http://www.utne.com/Environment/Utne-Reader-Visionaries-Gary-Paul-Nabhan-Native-Seeds.aspx","#cite_ref-Nabhan_2-0","http://www.awestthatworks.com/2Essays/Radical_Center/Radical_Center.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Gary_Paul_Nabhan&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Gary_Paul_Nabhan&veaction=edit&section=3","http://www.garynabhan.com/","http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n82-58304","/wiki/WorldCat","http://www.wholeterrain.org/bio.cfm?Contributor_ID=236","/wiki/Whole_Terrain","/wiki/Template:Ethnobiology","/wiki/Template_talk:Ethnobiology","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Ethnobiology&action=edit","/wiki/Ethnobiology","/wiki/Ethnobotany","/wiki/Ethnozoology","/wiki/Ethnoecology","/wiki/File:Ethnobio_image.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/78/Ethnobio_image.JPG/160px-Ethnobio_image.JPG","/wiki/Ethnoentomology","/wiki/Ethnoherpetology","/wiki/Ethnoichthyology","/wiki/Ethnolichenology","/wiki/Ethnomycology","/wiki/Ethnoornithology","/wiki/Cultural_ecology","/wiki/Ecological_anthropology","/wiki/Ethnoarchaeology","/wiki/Ethnomedicine","/wiki/Historical_ecology","/wiki/Human_ecology","/wiki/Paleoethnobotany","/wiki/Zooarchaeology","/wiki/William_Bal%C3%A9e","/wiki/Brent_Berlin","/wiki/Harold_Conklin","/wiki/Wade_Davis","/wiki/Roy_Ellen","/wiki/Andrew_Pawley","/wiki/Darrell_A._Posey","/wiki/Richard_Evans_Schultes","/wiki/Constantino_Manuel_Torres","/wiki/Nancy_Turner","/wiki/Category:Ethnobiology","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Anthropology","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/94734157","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Gary,_Indiana","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gary_Paul_Nabhan&oldid=542001671","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1952_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Northern_Arizona_University_faculty","/wiki/Category:University_of_Arizona_faculty","/wiki/Category:American_environmentalists","/wiki/Category:John_Burroughs_Medal_recipients","/wiki/Category:MacArthur_Fellows","/wiki/Category:Ethnobotanists","/wiki/Category:Radical_centrist_writers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gary+Paul+Nabhan&type=sig
