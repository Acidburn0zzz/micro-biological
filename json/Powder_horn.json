The term may also be\nused for any personal container for gunpowder, regardless of material or shape,\nfor which powder flask is the strictly correct term. Typically there was a\nstopper at both ends, in later examples spring-loaded to close automatically for\nsafety. In 1833 a letter to the English magazine The Sportsman's Cabinet,\nand Town and Country Magazine expained graphically the need for such safety\ndevives, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IXAXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA173&dq google\nbooks] The wide mouth was used for refilling, while the powder was\ndispensed from the narrow point. In some cases the point was closed and the\nmouth used for both, with a powder measure, a type of scoop used to dispense the\npowder, and in others both ends were open and the horn merely used as a funnel.\nThe horn was typically held by a long strap and slung over the\nshoulder. Garry, 192\n\nAlthough forms of pre-packed cartridges go back to the Middle Ages, many forms\nof early firearms did not use them, or users preferred to load each charge\nbefore firing. Most cartridges were prepared by the gun-owner and a container\nwas still needed for the gunpowder used to make them up. There were other\nmethods, including small cloth bags containing the correct amount for a single\nshot, that might be carried on a bandolier (again requiring a container for a\nsupply for refilling). An important safety concern was that when reloading a muzzle-\nloading gun soon after a shot there might be small pieces of wadding burning in\nthe muzzle, which would cause the new load of powder to ignite as a flash. So\nlong as no part of the loader faced the end of the barrel this was not dangerous\nin itself, but if a spark reached the main supply in the powder flask a fatal\nexplosion was likely. Various precautions were taken in the design and use of\npowder flasks to avoid this happening.\n\nSome types of guns required two different forms of gunpowder (such as a\nflintlock with finer priming powder for the pan, and different powder for the\nmain charge), necessitating two containers, a main horn and a smaller \"priming\nhorn\". Garry, 192 In particular, the powder horn was rendered obsolete\nby the innovations brought about by Hall, Sharps, Spencer and the later\ndevelopment of self-contained cartridges that were developed and marketed\nsuccessfully by Oliver Winchester, after which manufactured cartridges or\nbullets became standard.\n\nPowder horns were also used for the priming of large naval guns, and in blasting\noperations; apparently sometimes the horn shape was merely a convenient form of\nfunnel in such cases, and was open at both ends and not used as a container.\n\nThe use of animal horn along with nonferrous metal parts ensured that the powder\nwould not be detonated by sparks during storage and loading. Horn was also\nnaturally waterproof and already hollow inside. In America, a number of period\nhorns dating from the French and Indian wars throughout the American Revolution\nand beyond, have been preserved in private and other collections. Many decorated\nexamples shed light on the life and history of the individuals that used them,\nand can be classified as a medium of folk art.\n\nPowder horns were often decorated, most often with engraving, making a form\nof scrimshaw, which was sometimes supplemented with colour, and less often\nwith carving.\n","linknr":121,"url":"Powder_horn","recorded":1376423453,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Powder_horn&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Powder_horn&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_horn","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Jonathan_Gardner_Powder_horn_1776_at_the_Concord_Mass_Museum.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Jonathan_Gardner_Powder_horn_1776_at_the_Concord_Mass_Museum.JPG/270px-Jonathan_Gardner_Powder_horn_1776_at_the_Concord_Mass_Museum.JPG","/wiki/File:Jonathan_Gardner_Powder_horn_1776_at_the_Concord_Mass_Museum.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Concord_Museum","/wiki/File:Royal_navy_power_horn.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Royal_navy_power_horn.JPG/270px-Royal_navy_power_horn.JPG","/wiki/File:Royal_navy_power_horn.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Royal_Navy","/wiki/Gunpowder","/wiki/Ox","/wiki/Horn_(anatomy)","/wiki/Powder_flask","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Funnel","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)","/wiki/Bandolier","/wiki/Flintlock","#cite_note-3","/wiki/John_H._Hall_(soldier)","/wiki/Christian_Sharps","/wiki/Christopher_Miner_Spencer","/wiki/Oliver_Winchester","/wiki/Blasting","/wiki/Nonferrous","/wiki/French_and_Indian_war","/wiki/American_Revolution","/wiki/Folk_art","/wiki/Engraving","/wiki/Scrimshaw","/w/index.php?title=Powder_horn&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Powder_horn&veaction=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Powder_horns","#cite_ref-1","http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IXAXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA173&dq","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","/w/index.php?title=Powder_horn&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Powder_horn&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0806188006","/w/index.php?title=Powder_horn&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Powder_horn&veaction=edit&section=3","/wiki/Historic_Deerfield","http://www.historic-deerfield.org/events/engraved-powder-horns-french-and-indian-war-and-american-revolution-william-h-guthman-collect","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Powder_horn&oldid=566855471","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Early_firearms","/wiki/Category:Containers","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Powder+horn&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Powder+horn","/wiki/Powder_horn","/wiki/Talk:Powder_horn","#","/wiki/Powder_horn","/w/index.php?title=Powder_horn&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Powder_horn&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Powder_horn&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Powder_horn","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Powder_horn","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Powder_horn&oldid=566855471","/w/index.php?title=Powder_horn&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7236012","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Powder_horn&id=566855471","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Powder+horn","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Powder+horn&oldid=566855471&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Powder_horn&printable=yes","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polvarim","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7236012#siteli
