{"cursor":"16079","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'landrace' is a local variety of a domesticated animal or plant species which\nhas developed largely by natural\nprocesses, http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/landrace\nby adaptation to the natural and cultural environment in which it lives. It\ndiffers from a formal breed which has been selectively bred deliberately to\nconform to a particular formal, purebreed standard of traits. Landraces are\nusually more genetically and physically diverse than formal breeds. Many formal\nbreeds originated from attempts to make landraces more consistent, and sometimes\na particular type has both landrace and formal breed populations. Sometimes a\nformalised breed retains a landrace name, despite no longer being a true\nlandrace. When an animal landrace is codified as a pedigree breed without\nsignificant selective breeding to alter it, though often to lock in its defining\ntraits, it is often referred to as a 'natural breed' or 'traditional breed' by\nbreeder and fancier organisations. Similarly, the term 'traditional variety' is\nsometimes applied to plant landraces.\n\nLandraces are distinct from ancestral species of modern stock, and from separate\nspecies or subspecies derived from the same ancestor as modern domestic stock.\nLandraces are not all derived from ancient stock unmodified by human breeding\ninterests. In a number of cases, most commonly dogs, domestic animals have\nreverted to \"wild\" status by escaping in sufficient numbers in an area to breed\nferal populations that, through evolutionary pressure, form new landraces in\nonly a few centuries. Modern plant cultivars can also fairly quickly produce new\nlandraces through undirected breeding.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"landrace","recorded":1376418418,"links":[],"instances":["pig","sheep","cat","cat","cattle","biology","food","dog","ecology","animal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Landraces|","Biology terminology","Breeds","Domesticated plants","Domesticated animals","Rare breed conservation"],"headings":["Plants","Survival","Domestic Animals","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["morphology","biology"],["indigenous","ecology"],["manx","cat"],["siberian","cat"],["pineywoods","cattle"],["silver_fox","animal"],["game","food"],["newfoundland","dog"],["spælsau","sheep"],["swedish_landrace","pig"]],"members":["swedish_landrace","spælsau","manx","siberian","pineywoods","morphology","game","newfoundland","indigenous","silver_fox"],"related":["Domestication","Breed","Selective_breeding","Purebred","Genotype","Phenotype","Species","Feral","Evolutionary_pressure","Botany","Agriculture","Horticulture","Anthropology","Morphology_(biology)","Soil_types","Bulgur","Populations","Pathogens","Indigenous_(ecology)","Heirloom_plant","Industrial_agriculture","Heterogeneous","Nomenclature","Cultivar","Pigeonpea","Germplasm","Bioversity_International","Egyptian_Mau","Norwegian_Forest_Cat","Maine_Coon","Manx_(cat)","Siberian_(cat)","Turkish_Angora","Pineywoods_(cattle)","Florida_Cracker_cattle","Randall_Cattle","Icelandic_chicken","Swedish_Flower_Hen","Dog","Dog_breed","Dog_type","Gray_wolf","Dmitry_Konstantinovich_Belyaev","Silver_fox_(animal)","Domesticated_silver_fox","Border_Collie","Herding_dog","Middle_East","Saluki","Game_(food)","Hare","St._John's_water_dog","Labrador_Retriever","Chesapeake_Bay_Retriever","Newfoundland_(dog)","Carolina_Dog","Mountain_dog","Armenian_Gampr_dog","Swedish_Blue_duck","Swedish_Yellow_duck","Twente_Landrace","Shetland_sheep","Spanish_goat","Southern_United_States","Gulf_Coast_Native_sheep","Spælsau_(sheep)","Iron_Age","Welsh_Mountain_sheep","Dutch_Landrace","Swedish_Landrace","Finnish_Landrace_Goat","Danish_Landrace_Goat","Horse_breeding","Horse","Feral_horse","New_Forest_pony","Exmoor_pony","New_Forest","Arabian_horse","Andalusian_horse","Banker_horse","Przewalski's_horse","Wild_horse","Mulefoot_Hog","Danish_Landrace","American_Landrace","Swedish_Landrace_(pig)","British_Landrace","American_Livestock_Breeds_Conservancy"]}
