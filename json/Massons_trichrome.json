{"cursor":"3093","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" is stained blue, nuclei are stained dark red/purple, and cytoplasm is stained\n red/pink.]] 'Masson's trichrome' is a three-colour staining protocol used in\n histology. The recipes evolved from Claude L. Pierre Masson's (1880-1959)\n original formulation to different specific applications, but all are suited for\n distinguishing cells from surrounding connective tissue.\n\nMost recipes produce red keratin and muscle fibers, blue or green collagen and\nbone, light red or pink cytoplasm, and dark brown to black cell nuclei.\n\nThe trichrome is applied by immersion of the fixated sample into Weigert's iron\nhematoxylin, and then three different solutions, labeled A, B, and C:\n* Weigert's hematoxylin is a sequence of three solutions: ferric chloride\n  in diluted hydrochloric acid, hematoxylin in 95% ethanol, and potassium\n  ferricyanide solution alkalized by sodium borate. It is used to stain\n  the nuclei.\n* Solution A, also called 'plasma stain', contains acid fuchsin, Xylidine\n  Ponceau, glacial acetic acid, and distilled water. Other red acid dyes can be\n  used, e.g. the Biebrich scarlet in Lillie's trichrome.\n* Solution B contains phosphomolybdic acid in distilled water.\n* Solution C, also called 'fibre stain', contains Light Green SF yellowish, or\n  alternatively Fast Green FCF. It is used to stain collagen. If blue is\n  preferred to green, methyl blue, water blue or aniline blue can be\n  substituted.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Masson's_trichrome","recorded":1376428367,"links":[],"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Staining"],"headings":["Variants","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["staining","biology"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell","staining"],"related":["Cell_nucleus","Cytoplasm","Staining_(biology)","Histology","Claude_L._Pierre_Masson","Cell_(biology)","Connective_tissue","Keratin","Muscle_fiber","Collagen","Bone","Cytoplasm","Cell_nucleus","Weigert's_iron_hematoxylin","Hematoxylin","Ferric_chloride","Hydrochloric_acid","Hematoxylin","Ethanol","Potassium_ferricyanide","Sodium_borate","Fuchsin","Ponceau_2R","Glacial_acetic_acid","Distilled_water","Biebrich_scarlet","Phosphomolybdic_acid","Light_Green_SF_yellowish","Fast_Green_FCF","Methyl_blue","Water_blue","Aniline_blue","Lillie's_trichrome","Blood_vessel","Elastin"]}
