The term \"man-made\n mineral fibres\" is generally used to refer solely to synthetic materials\n including fibreglass, ceramic fibres and 'stone wool'. Industrial applications\n of mineral wool include thermal insulation (as both structural insulation and\n pipe insulation), filtration, soundproofing, and germination of seedlings.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Rock_wool","recorded":1376428522,"links":[],"instances":["material","firestopping","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Materials","Building insulation materials"],"headings":["History","Manufacture","Usage","Safety of material","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["micrometer","unit"],["binder","material"],["packing","firestopping"]],"members":["binder","packing","micrometer"],"related":["Fiber","Mineral","Glass_wool","Ceramic","Thermal_insulation","Building_insulation","Pipe_insulation","Filtration","Soundproofing","Hydroponics","Wales","Georgsmarienhütte","Osnabrück","Germany","Lava","Spinning_wheel","Cotton_candy","Micrometer_(unit)","Binder_(material)","Mineral_oil","Dust","Heat_conduction","Thermal_insulation","Sound_absorption","Glass_wool","Ceramic","Building_material","Passive_fire_protection","Fireproofing","Wall_stud","Drywall","Packing_(firestopping)","Firestop","Bacteria","Resin_bonded_panel","Hydroponics","Gasket","Brake_pad","Plastic","Automotive","Filtration","Coating","Hydroponics","PH","Human_eye","Human_skin","Respiratory_tract","Carcinogen","Asbestos","International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer","List_of_IARC_Group_2B_carcinogens","Blast_furnace","Glass_wool","List_of_IARC_Group_3_carcinogens","Risk_and_Safety_Statements","Institute_of_Occupational_Medicine","Institute_of_Occupational_Medicine"]}
