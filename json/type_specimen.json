{"cursor":"25503","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'' - MHNT]] In biology, a 'type' is one particular (or in some cases a group of\nspecimens) of an organism to which the scientific name of that organism is\nformally attached. In other words, a type is an example that serves to anchor or\ncentralize the defining features of that particular taxon.\n\nA taxon is a scientifically named grouping of organisms with other like\norganisms, a set that includes some organisms and excludes others, based on a\ndetailed published description (for example a species description) and on the\nprovision of type material, which is usually available to scientists for\nexamination in a major museum research collection, or similar institution.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"type_specimen","recorded":1376418387,"links":[],"instances":["biology","zoology","taxonomy","biology","skull","biology","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biological concepts","Taxonomy","Zoological nomenclature","Botanical nomenclature"],"headings":["Type specimen","Older terminology","{{anchor|botany|Botany}} Types in botany","Types in zoology","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["taxonomy","biology"],["family","biology"],["circumscription","taxonomy"],["family","biology"],["calvaria","skull"],["morph","zoology"],["isotype","biology"]],"members":["isotype","morph","circumscription","taxonomy","calvaria","family","set"],"related":["MHNT","Organism","Scientific_name","Taxon","Set_(mathematics)","Species_description","International_Commission_on_Zoological_Nomenclature","ICBN","Taxonomist","Museum","Herbarium","Scientific_nomenclature","Alpha_taxonomy","Taxonomy_(biology)","Nomenclature_Codes","Natural_History_Museum,_London","Spotted_Harrier","Holotype","Genera","Family_(biology)","Systematics","Name-bearing_type","Taxa","Botany","Zoology","Phylogenetic_nomenclature","Taxon","Botanical_nomenclature","Herbarium","Microscope","Microscope_slide","Circumscription_(taxonomy)","Dandelion","Infraspecific_taxon","Taxon","Genus","Species","Family_(biology)","Genus","Cloning","International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature","Species","Johann_Karl_Fuhlrott","Calvaria_(skull)","Type_species","Nominal_species","Genus","Subgenus","Type_genus","Nominal_genus","Type_series","Holotype","Lectotype","Name-bearing_type","International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature","Species","Subspecies","Nematoda","Lectotype","Conspecificity","Neotype","Botanical_nomenclature","Zoological_nomenclature","Name-bearing_type","Syntype","Carl_Linnaeus","Protistan","RÃ©union_Parakeet","Bulo_Burti_Boubou","Bushshrike","Morph_(zoology)","Neotype","Allotype","Topotype","Generitype","Isotype_(biology)","Linnaeus","Genetics","Scientific_classification","Nomen_dubium","Nomen_nudum"]}
