{"cursor":"18201","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Taxonomy' (from [[taxis]], \"arrangement,\" and [[:wikt:-nomy|-nomia]],\n\"method\") is the academic discipline of defining groups of biological\norganisms on the basis of shared characteristics and giving names to those\ngroups. Each group is given a rank and groups of a given rank can be aggregated\nto form a super group of higher rank and thus create a hierarchical\nclassification. Judd, W.S., Campbell, C.S., Kellog, E.A., Stevens,\nP.F., Donoghue, M.J. (2007) Taxonomy. In Plant Systematics - A Phylogenetic\nApproach, Third Edition. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland. The groups created through this process are referred to as\n'taxa' (singular taxon). An example of a modern classification is the one\npublished in 2009 by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group for all living flowering\nplant families (the APG III system).\n\nCarolus Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist is regarded as the father of\nmodern taxonomy.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"taxonomists","recorded":1376418375,"links":[],"instances":["biology","biology","biology","biology","biology","biology","biology","biology","pliny","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Taxonomy|","Classification systems","Nomenclature"],"headings":["Definition","Application","Taxonomic descriptions","Classifying organisms","History of taxonomy","Databases","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["homonym","biology"],["type","biology"],["domain","biology"],["kingdom","biology"],["class","biology"],["order","biology"],["family","biology"],["natural_history","pliny"],["morphology","biology"],["identification","biology"],["type","biology"]],"members":["kingdom","homonym","identification","morphology","domain","order","type","class","natural_history","family"],"related":["Scientific_method","Academic_discipline","Biological_classification","Taxon","Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group","Flowering_plant","APG_III_system","Carl_Linnaeus","Systematics","Biological_nomenclature","Biology","Naturalist","Biodiversity","Conservation_biology","Biological_classification","Scientific_community","Pitcher_plant","Zoology","Nomenclature","Taxonomic_rank","Subspecies","Botany","Phycology","Mycology","Binomial_nomenclature","Homonym_(biology)","Type_(biology)","Quantitative_property","Qualitative_data","DNA_sequence","Biological_classification","Domain_(biology)","Kingdom_(biology)","Phylum","Class_(biology)","Order_(biology)","Family_(biology)","Genus","Species","Phylogenetic","Clades","Cladistic","Plesiomorph","Neighbor_joining","Bayesian_inference","Shennong","Aristotle","Invertebrates","Vertebrates","Theophrastus","Pliny_the_Elder","Natural_History_(Pliny)","Morphology_(biology)","Andrea_Cesalpino","Magnum_opus","Asteraceae","Brassicaceae","John_Ray","Joseph_Pitton_de_Tournefort","Carl_Linnaeus","Linnaean_system","Candolle","Taxonomic_database","Alpha_taxonomy","Barcode_of_Life","Biological_classification","Evolutionary_taxonomy","Identification_(biology)","Nomenclature","Phylogenetics","Species_description","Species_problem","Systematics","Type_(biology)"]}
