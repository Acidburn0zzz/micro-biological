{"cursor":"6217","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Space environment' is a branch of astronautics, aerospace engineering and space\nphysics that seeks to understand and address conditions existing in space that\naffect the operation of spacecraft. A related subject, space weather, deals with\ndynamic processes in the solar-terrestrial system that can give rise to effects\non spacecraft, but that can also affect the atmosphere, ionosphere and\ngeomagnetic field, giving rise to several other kinds of effects on human\ntechnologies.\n\nEffects on spacecraft can arise from radiation, space debris and meteoroid\nimpact, upper atmospheric drag and spacecraft electrostatic charging.\n\nRadiation in space usually comes from three main sources: (i) the Van Allen\nradiation belts; (ii) solar proton events and solar energetic particles; and\n(iii) galactic cosmic rays. For long duration missions, the high doses of\nradiation can damage electronic components and solar cells. A major concern is\nalso radiation-induced \"single-event effects\" such as single event upset. Manned\nmissions usually avoid the radiation belts and the international space station\nis at an altitude well below the most severe regions of the radiation belts.\nDuring solar energetic events (solar flares and coronal mass ejections)\nparticles can be accelerated to very high energies and can reach the Earth in\ntimes as short as 30 minutes (but usually take some hours). These particles are\nmainly protons and heavier ions that can cause radiation damage, disruption to\nlogic circuits and even hazards to astronauts. Manned missions to return to the\nMoon or to travel to Mars will have to deal with the major problems presented by\nsolar particle events to radiation safety, in addition to the important\ncontribution to doses from the low-level background cosmic rays. In near-Earth\norbits, the Earth's geomagnetic field screens spacecraft from a large part of\nthese hazards - a process called geomagnetic shielding.\n\nSpace debris and meteoroids can impact spacecraft at high speeds, causing\nmechanical or electrical damage. The average speed of space debris is 10 km/s\n[http://www.awhir.com/design/nasa/Meteoroids%2520and%2520Orbital%2520Debri-\ns--%2520Effects%2520on%2520Spacecraft%2520rp1408.pdf Meteoroids and Orbital\nDebris: Effects on Spacecraft (NASA Reference Publication 1408)] while the\naverage speed of meteoroids is much greater. For example, the meteoroids\nassociated with the Perseid meteor shower travel at an average speed of 58 km/s. [http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-\nnasa/1999/ast09aug99_1/ Here Come the Perseids!] Mechanical damage from\ndebris impacts have been studied through space missions including LDEF, which\nhad over 20,000 documented impacts through its 5.7 year\nmission. [http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/protect/impacts.html Orbital\nDebris Impacts on Spacecraft] Electrical anomalies associated with impact\nevents include ESA's Olympus spacecraft, which lost attitude control during the\n1993 Perseid meteor\nshower. [http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympus.html The\nsad story of Olympus 1] A similar event occurred with the Landsat 5\nspacecraft [http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=2281 Landsat 5\nExperiences Malfunction] during the 2009 Perseid meteor shower. [http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-\nnasa/2009/31jul_perseids2009/ The 2009 Perseid Meteor Shower]\n\nSpacecraft electrostatic charging is caused by the hot plasma environment around\nthe Earth. The plasma encountered in the region of the geostationary orbit\nbecomes heated during geomagnetic \"sub-storms\" caused by disturbances in the\nsolar wind. \"Hot\" electrons (with energies in the kilo-electron volt range)\ncollect on surfaces of spacecraft and can establish electrostatic potentials of\nthe order of kilovolts. As a result, discharges can occur and are known to be\nthe source of many spacecraft anomalies.\n\nSolutions devised by scientists and engineers include, but are not limited to,\nspacecraft shielding, special \"hardening\" of electronic systems, various\ncollision detection systems. Evaluation of effects during spacecraft design\nincludes application of various \"models' of the environment, including radiation\nbelt models, spacecraft-plasma interaction models and atmospheric models to\npredict drag effects encountered in lower orbits and during reentery.\n\nThe field often overlaps with the disciplines of astrophysics, atmospheric\nscience, space physics, and geophysics, albeit usually with an emphasis on\napplication.\n\nThe United States government maintains a Space Weather Prediction Center at\nBoulder, Colorado. The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) is part of the\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). SWPC is one of the\nNational Weather Service's (NWS) National Centers for Environmental\nPrediction (NCEP).\n\nSpace weather effects on Earth can include ionospheric storms, temporary\ndecreases in ozone densities, disruption to radio communication, to GPS signals\nand submarine positioning. Some scientists also theorize links between sunspot\nactivity and ice ages.\n[http://ff.org/centers/csspp/library/co2weekly/20060920/20060920_13.html]\n","linknr":156,"url":"space_environment","recorded":1376415221,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Space_environment&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Space_environment&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Astronautics","/wiki/Aerospace_engineering","/wiki/Space_physics","/wiki/Space_weather","/wiki/Ionosphere","/wiki/Geomagnetic_field","/wiki/Radiation","/wiki/Space_debris","/wiki/Meteoroid","/wiki/Atmospheric_drag","/w/index.php?title=Electrostatic_charging&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belts","/wiki/Solar_proton_event","/wiki/Solar_energetic_particle","/wiki/Cosmic_rays","/wiki/Single_event_upset","/wiki/International_space_station","/wiki/Solar_flares","/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejections","/wiki/Cosmic_rays","/wiki/Geomagnetic_field","/w/index.php?title=Geomagnetic_shielding&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Perseids","#cite_note-2","/wiki/LDEF","#cite_note-3","/wiki/ESA","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Landsat_5","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Plasma_(physics)","/wiki/Geostationary","/wiki/Electron_volt","/wiki/Astrophysics","/wiki/Atmospheric_science","/wiki/Space_physics","/wiki/Geophysics","/wiki/Space_Weather_Prediction_Center","/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado","/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration","/wiki/NOAA","/wiki/National_Weather_Service","/wiki/National_Centers_for_Environmental_Prediction","/wiki/Space_weather","/wiki/Ionosphere","/wiki/Ozone","/wiki/GPS","/wiki/Sunspot","/wiki/Ice_age","http://ff.org/centers/csspp/library/co2weekly/20060920/20060920_13.html","/w/index.php?title=Space_environment&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Space_environment&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.awhir.com/design/nasa/Meteoroids%2520and%2520Orbital%2520Debris--%2520Effects%2520on%2520Spacecraft%2520rp1408.pdf","#cite_ref-2","http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/ast09aug99_1/","#cite_ref-3","http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/protect/impacts.html","#cite_ref-4","http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympus.html","#cite_ref-5","http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=2281","#cite_ref-6","http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/31jul_perseids2009/","/w/index.php?title=Space_environment&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Space_environment&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/Astronautics","/wiki/European_Cooperation_for_Space_Standardization","/wiki/Karman_line","/wiki/Outer_space","/wiki/SEDAT","/wiki/SPENVIS","/wiki/Space_science","/wiki/Space_weather","/w/index.php?title=Space_environment&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Space_environment&veaction=edit&section=3","http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/","http://spacewx.com/","http://spaceweather.usu.edu/","http://space-env.esa.int/","http://www.spenvis.oma.be/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_environment&oldid=562968313","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Spaceflight","/wiki/Category:Aerospace_engineering","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Space+environment&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Space+environment","/wiki/Space_environment","/wiki/Talk:Space_environment","#","/wiki/Space_environment","/w/index.php?title=Space_environment&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Space_environment&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Space_environment&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
