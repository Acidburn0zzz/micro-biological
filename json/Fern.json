Chapman, Arthur D. (2009). Numbers of Living Species in Australia\nand the World. Report for the Australian Biological Resources Study. Canberra,\nAustralia. September 2009. http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/other/species-\nnumbers/index.html Unlike mosses, they have xylem and phloem (making them\nvascular plants). They have stems, leaves, and roots like other vascular plants.\nFerns reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. Most ferns have\nwhat are called fiddleheads. The fiddleheads expand into what are called fronds,\nwhich are each delicately divided. http://www.sunset.com/garden/flowers-plants/rediscover-ferns-\n00400000016579/\n\nBy far the largest group of ferns is the leptosporangiate ferns, but ferns as\ndefined here (also called 'monilophytes') include horsetails, whisk ferns,\nmarattioid ferns, and ophioglossoid ferns. The term 'pteridophyte' traditionally\nrefers to ferns and a few other seedless vascular plants (see classification\nsection below), although some recent authors have used the term to refer\nstrictly to the monilophytes.\n\nFerns first appear in the fossil record 360 million years ago in the\nCarboniferous but many of the current families and species did not appear until\nroughly 145 million years ago in the early Cretaceous (after flowering plants\ncame to dominate many environments).\n\nFerns are not of major economic importance, but some are grown or gathered for\nfood, as ornamental plants, for remediating contaminated soils, and have been\nthe subject of research for their ability to remove some chemical pollutants\nfrom the air. Some are significant weeds. They also play a role in mythology,\nmedicine, and art.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Fern","recorded":1376418373,"links":[],"instances":["biology","state"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pteridophyta|","Fern florae|","Non-timber forest products"],"headings":["Life cycle","Fern ecology","Fern structure","Evolution and classification","Uses","Culture","Organisms confused with ferns","Gallery","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["colony","biology"],["oaxaca","state"]],"members":["colony","oaxaca"],"related":["Frond","Plant","Cladoxylopsida","Psilotopsida","Equisetopsida","Marattiopsida","Polypodiopsida","Zygopteridales","Stauropteridales","Rhacophytales","Species","Plant","Moss","Xylem","Phloem","Vascular_plants","Plant_stem","Leaf","Root","Spore","Seed","Flower","Frond","Leptosporangiate_fern","Horsetail","Whisk_fern","Marattioid_fern","Ophioglossoid_fern","Carboniferous","Cretaceous","Ornamental_plant","List_of_air-filtering_plants","Vascular_plant","Lycophyte","Leaf","Pinnate","Seed_plant","Gymnosperm","Angiosperm","Seed","Biological_life_cycle","Alternation_of_generations","Diploid","Sporophyte","Haploid","Gametophyte","Chromosome","Spore","Meiosis","Prothallus","Gametes","Sperm","Ovum","Mitosis","Flagellum","Zygote","Habitat","Mountain","Desert","Flowering_plant","Bracken","Forest","Bog","Swamp","Tree","Epiphyte","Mycorrhizal","North_America","Acid","Limestone","Lipid","Protein","Calories","European_woodmouse","Bullfinch","New_Zealand_lesser_short-tailed_bat","Plant_stem","Rhizome","Stolon","Polypodiaceae","Cyatheaceae","Norfolk_Island","New_Zealand","Leaf","Green","Photosynthesis","Frond","Fiddlehead","Circinate_vernation","Sporophyll","Sporangia","Sorus","Blechnaceae","Lomariopsidaceae","Root","Soil","Fibrous_root_system","Antheridium","Flagellum","Archegonium","Rhizoid","Root","Carboniferous","Triassic","Cretaceous","Phylum","Tracheophyta","Leptosporangiate_fern","Pteridophyte","Vascular_plant","Fern_allies","Ophioglossaceae","Ophioglossum","Moonwort","Grape-fern","Marattiaceae","Fern_ally","Clubmoss","Spikemoss","Isoëtes","Lycopodiophyta","Whisk_fern","Psilotaceae","Horsetail","Equisetaceae","Vascular_plant","Clade","Equisetopsida","Psilotopsida","Psilotaceae","Ophioglossoid_fern","Equisetopsida","Horsetail","Marattiopsida","Polypodiopsida","Bracken","Ostrich_fern","Cinnamon_fern","New_Zealand","Oceania","Anna_Revedin","PNAS","Guanches","Gofio","Canary_Islands","Licorice_fern","Rhizome","Pacific_Northwest","Mosquito_fern","Nitrogen_fixation","Horticulture","Foliage","Houseplant","Boston_fern","Nephrolepis","Asplenium_nidus","Staghorn_fern","Weed","Invasive_species","Sensitive_fern","Coal","Vermifuge","US_Pharmacopeia","Wardian_case","Floristry","List_of_freshwater_aquarium_plant_species","Arsenic","Tree_fern","Parkeriaceae","Lycophyte","Pteridomania","Victorian_era","Fads_and_trends","Collecting","Decorative_art","Pottery","Glass","Metal","Textile","Wood","Printing","Sculpture","Infant_baptism","Gravestone","Wardian_case","Chaos_game","Iterated_function_system","Nature_printing","Alois_Auer","Silver_fern","New_Zealand","Emblem","Silver_Ferns","All_Blacks","Slavic_folklore","Ivan_Kupala_Day","Fern_flower","Finland","Seed","Midsummer","Will_o'_the_wisp","Aarnivalkea","Treasure","Monocotyledon","Air_fern","Animal","Hydrozoa","Jellyfish","Coral","Colony_(biology)","Angiosperms","Arecaceae","Apiaceae","Pinnate","Ernst_Haeckel","Oaxaca_(state)","San_Diego,_CA","Rotorua","New_Zealand","Sequoia_sempervirens","Santa_Cruz,_CA","Nature_printing","The_Ferns_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","Franklin,_Virginia","British_Pteridological_Society","Chirosia_betuleti","Fern_spike","Fern_sports","Fiddlehead_greens","Pteridomania"]}
