The collaboration was formed to organize medical research\ninformation in a systematic way in the interests of evidence-based\nmedicine. *\n\nThe group conducts systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials of health-\ncare interventions, which it publishes in the Cochrane Library. *Ben\nGoldacre (2012), [[Bad Pharma]], Fourth Estate, p. 14ff. A few reviews (in\nfields such as occupational health) have also studied the results of non-\nrandomized, observational studies.\n\nThe collaboration formed an official relationship in January 2011 with the World\nHealth Organization as a partner NGO, with a seat on the World Health Assembly\nto provide input into WHO resolutions. *\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Cochrane_Collaboration","recorded":1376428440,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Systematic review","Evidence-based medicine","Evidence-based practices","Healthcare quality","Patient-centered Healthcare","International non-profit organizations"],"headings":["History","Logo","Reception","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Non-profit_organization","Oxford,_England","Nonprofit_organization","Evidence-based_medicine","Systematic_review","Randomized_controlled_trial","Cochrane_Library","Ben_Goldacre","Occupational_health","Observational_study","World_Health_Organization","Iain_Chalmers","Archie_Cochrane","National_Health_Service","Michael_Peckham","Cochrane_Consumer_Network","Logo","Placebo","Forest_plot","Systematic_review","Corticosteroid","Birth","Odds","Evidence-based_medicine","Cochrane_Library","Systematic_review"]}
