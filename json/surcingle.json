{"cursor":"3049","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'surcingle' is a strap made of leather or leather-like synthetic materials\nsuch as nylon or neoprene, sometimes with elastic, that fastens around a horse's\ngirth area. A surcingle may be used for ground training, some types of in-hand\nexhibition, and over a saddle or horse pack to stabilize the load. It also is a\nprimary component of a horse harness.\n\nA basic surcingle is unpadded, attaches around the horse by means of buckles or\nrings, and has no other hardware. A training surcingle, sometimes called a\n\"roller,\" has many extra rings attached, running from the ribcage up to the\nwithers area. It usually has padding to relieve pressure on the spine. A\nvariation of this design is used for equestrian vaulting.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"surcingle","recorded":1376429070,"links":[],"instances":["horse_show"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Saddles","Harness","Horse tack"],"headings":["Uses","Placement","See also","References","Sources"],"image":[],"tags":[["halter","horse_show"]],"members":["halter"],"related":["Horse","Girth","Horse_training","Halter_(horse_show)","Saddle","Packhorse","Horse_harness","Equestrian_vaulting","Saddle","Longeing","Side_reins","Overcheck","Lauffer_rein","Chambon","Pack_saddle","Longeing","Horse_harness","Bitting_rig"]}
