{"cursor":"3991","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Martin Frank Stainforth' (14 August 1866 â 22 April 1957) was a British-born\nartist best known for his portraits of Thoroughbred racehorses he painted in\nEngland and while living in Australia and the United States.\n\nBorn at Martley, Worcestershire, Stainforth began his artistic career as a\ntraditional artist doing religious portraits and wood engravings in the vein of\nthe Italian Old Masters. The quality of his work brought invitations to exhibit\nat the Royal Academy as well as at venues in Berlin, Germany, Brussels, Belgium\nand Paris, France. At the beginning of the 20th century, he began working as a\nmagazine illustrator but a visit to North Queensland, Australia in 1908, led to\nhis settling there and developing his skills as a painter of animals and\nespecially equine portraiture. Among his works there is a portrait of the 1912\nAJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner, Trafalgar. The publication \"Racehorses In\nAustralia with paintings by Martin Stainforth\" is an important standard\nreference work in Australian Thoroughbred literature. First published in 1922\nwith many tipped in plates, a facsimile reprint was issued in 1983 but without\nany tipping in. Good copies of the original with dust jackets are hard to find.\nThe book contained reproductions of paintings of many notable Thoroughbreds\nincluding Carbine, Comedy King, Kennaquhair, Poitrel and Eurythmic.\n\nMartin Stainforth lived in Sydney for close to twenty years but around 1928 he\nspent time in New Zealand before returning to his native England in 1930 where\nhe was commissioned to do the portraits of a number of racehorses including\nHyperion for Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby and other prominent owners such\nas King George V. Near the end of 1934 Stainforth moved to New York City where\nhe would remain for nearly fifteen years, spending considerable time at the\nhotel Breslin. He was hired to paint many famous American horses, including\nfuture U.S. Hall of Fame horse, Johnstown and 1937 U.S. Triple Crown winner, War\nAdmiral as well as early American champion Sir Archy and Man o' War.\n\nMartin Stainforth returned to England around 1949 where he died in 1957. Some of\nhis works can be seen at the Australian Jockey Club at Randwick Racecourse near\nSydney, New South Wales as well as at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of\nFame in Saratoga Springs, New York. A watercolour of Carbine by the artist (who\npainted the great horse on a number of occasions ) sold for A$25,000 at a\nSotheby's auction in Sydney in late 2007.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Martin_Stainforth","recorded":1376423596,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Martin_Stainforth&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Martin_Stainforth&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Stainforth","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Art","/wiki/Thoroughbred","/wiki/Horse_racing","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Martley","/wiki/Worcestershire","/wiki/Italy","/wiki/Old_Master","/wiki/Royal_Academy","/wiki/Berlin","/wiki/Brussels","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Regions_of_Queensland","/wiki/Equine","/wiki/AJC_Queen_Elizabeth_Stakes","/w/index.php?title=Trafalgar_(horse)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Carbine_(horse)","/wiki/Kennaquhair_(horse)","/wiki/Eurythmic_(horse)","/wiki/Sydney","/wiki/New_Zealand","/wiki/Hyperion_(horse)","/wiki/Edward_Stanley,_17th_Earl_of_Derby","/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Johnstown_(horse)","/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing#United_States_Triple_Crowns","/wiki/War_Admiral","/wiki/Sir_Archy","/wiki/Man_o%27_War","/wiki/Australian_Jockey_Club","/wiki/Randwick_Racecourse","/wiki/Sydney","/wiki/New_South_Wales","/wiki/National_Museum_of_Racing_and_Hall_of_Fame","/wiki/Saratoga_Springs","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/A$","/w/index.php?title=Martin_Stainforth&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Martin_Stainforth&veaction=edit&section=1","http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120054b.htm","http://www.artnet.com/artist/649258/martin-stainforth.html","/w/index.php?title=Martin_Stainforth&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Martin_Stainforth&veaction=edit&section=2","http://www.archive.org/stream/racehorsesinaust00aust#page/56/mode/2up","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/17177422","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Stainforth&oldid=531263199","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1866_births","/wiki/Category:1957_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_artists","/wiki/Category:English_illustrators","/wiki/Category:English_engravers","/wiki/Category:Equine_artists","/wiki/Category:People_from_Malvern_Hills_(district)","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_May_2011","/wiki/Category:Use_British_English_from_May_2011","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Martin+Stainforth&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Martin+Stainforth","/wiki/Martin_Stainforth","/wiki/Talk:Martin_Stainforth","#","/wiki/Martin_Stainforth","/w/index.php?title=Martin_Stainforth&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Martin_Stainforth&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Martin_Stainforth&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Martin_Stainforth","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Martin_Stainforth","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Martin_Stainforth&oldid=531263199","/w/index.php?title=Martin_Stainforth&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6776647","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Martin_Stainforth&id=531263199","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Martin+Stainforth","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Martin+Stainforth&oldid=531263199&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Martin_Stainforth&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6776647#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia
