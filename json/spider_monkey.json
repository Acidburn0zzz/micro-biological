Like other\natelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from\nsouthern Mexico to Brazil. The genus contains seven species, all of which are\nunder threat; the black-headed spider monkey, wooly spider monkey, and brown\nspider monkey are critically endangered.\n\nTheir disproportionately long limbs and long prehensile tails make them one of\nthe largest New World monkeys and gives rise to their common name. Spider\nmonkeys live in the upper layers of the rainforest, and forage in the high\ncanopy, from . They primarily eat fruits, but will\nalso occasionally consume leaves, flowers, and insects.\nDue to their large size, spider monkeys require large tracts of moist evergreen\nforests, and prefer undisturbed primary rainforest. They\nare social animals and live in bands of up to 35 individuals but will split up\nto forage during the day.\n\nRecent meta-analyses on primate cognition studies indicated spider monkeys are\nthe most intelligent New World monkeys. They can produce a wide range\nof sounds and will \"bark\" when threatened; other vocalisations include a whinny\nsimilar to a horse and prolonged screams.\n\nThey are an important food source due to their large size, so are widely hunted\nby local human populations; they are also threatened by habitat destruction due\nto logging and land clearing. Spider monkeys are\nsusceptible to malaria and are used in laboratory studies of the disease. The population trend for spider monkeys is decreasing; the\nIUCN Red List lists one species as vulnerable, four species as endangered and\ntwo species as critically endangered.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"spider_monkey","recorded":1376418388,"links":[],"instances":["fruit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Spider monkeys and woolly monkeys"],"headings":["Evolutionary history","Anatomy and physiology","Behavior","Diet","Reproduction","In Mesoamerican cultures","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["territory","animal#scent_marking"],["nut","fruit"]],"members":["territory","nut"],"related":["Black-headed_spider_monkey","Animal","Chordata","Mammal","Eutheria","Primate","Atelidae","Atelinae","Ã‰tienne_Geoffroy_Saint-Hilaire","Carolus_Linnaeus","Genus","New_World_monkey","Atelinae","Atelidae","Tropical_forest","Mexico","Brazil","Black-headed_spider_monkey","Wooly_spider_monkey","Brown_spider_monkey","Prehensile_tail","Forage","Meta-analysis","Habitat_destruction","IUCN_Red_List","Vulnerable_species","Endangered_species","Critically_endangered_species","Atelinae","Woolly_spider_monkey","Speciation","Miocene","Megaannum","Howler_monkey","Atelinae","Red-faced_spider_monkey","Wooly_spider_monkey","White-fronted_spider_monkey","Peruvian_spider_monkey","Brown_spider_monkey","White-cheeked_spider_monkey","Black-headed_spider_monkey","Brown-headed_spider_monkey","Colombian_spider_monkey","Geoffroy's_spider_monkey","Yucatan_spider_monkey","Mexican_spider_monkey","Nicaraguan_spider_monkey","Ornate_spider_monkey","Yellow-tailed_woolly_monkey","The_Museum_of_Osteology","Oklahoma_City,_Oklahoma","Black-headed_spider_monkey","Common_name","Prehensile_tail","Fingerprint","Arboreal","Nostril","Gibbon","Clitoris","Pseudo-penis","Penis","Threatened","Habitat_loss","Fission-fusion_society","Primate","Chimpanzee","Puberty","Wooly_Spider_Monkey","Diurnal_animal","Tree","Personal_grooming","Brain","Howler_monkey","Frugivorous","Fruit","Nut_(fruit)","Seed","Fertilizer","Feces","Insects","Bark","Honey","Gestation","Mesoamerica"]}
