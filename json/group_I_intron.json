They catalyze their own\nexcision from mRNA, tRNA and rRNA precursors in a wide range of organisms. The core\nsecondary structure consists of nine paired regions (P1-P9). These\nfold to essentially two domains - the P4-P6 domain (formed from the stacking of\nP5, P4, P6 and P6a helices) and the P3-P9 domain (formed from the P8, P3, P7 and\nP9 helices). The secondary structure mark-up for this family\nrepresents only this conserved core. Group I introns often have long open\nreading frames inserted in loop regions.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"group_I_intron","recorded":1376418389,"links":[],"instances":["chemistry","protein","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ribozymes","RNA splicing"],"headings":["Catalysis","Intron folding","Distribution, phylogeny and mobility","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["splicing","genetics"],["folding","chemistry"],["chaperone","protein"]],"members":["folding","chaperone","splicing"],"related":["Secondary_structure","Sequence_conservation","Intron","Eukaryota","Bacteria","Virus","Ribozymes","Biocatalysis","MRNA","TRNA","RRNA","Secondary_structure","Protein_domains","Introns","Open_reading_frame","Stem-loop","Splicing_(genetics)","Ester","Exogenous","Guanosine","Nucleotide","Phosphodiester_bond","Exon","Covalent_bond","Polymerases","Phosphatases","Group_II_intron","In_vitro","Folding_(chemistry)","RNA_tertiary_structure","Metastable","Thermodynamic","Kinetic_energy","Chaperone_(protein)","Gene","RRNA","MRNA","TRNA","Mitochondria","Chloroplast","Nuclear_gene","Bacteriophage_","Gram-positive_bacteria","Gram-negative_bacteria","Enterobacteria_phage_T4","T7_phage_","Homing_endonuclease","GISSD","Cyclic_di-GMP-II_riboswitch"]}
