{"cursor":"5864","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nTransmission of an infection requires three conditions: *an infectious\nindividual *a susceptible individual *an effective contact between them\n\nAn 'effective contact' is defined as any kind of contact between two individuals\nsuch that, if one individual is infectious and the other susceptible, then the\nfirst individual infects the second. Whether or not a particular kind of contact\nwill be effective depends on the infectious agent and its route of transmission.\n\nThe 'effective contact rate' (denoted Î²) in a given population for a given\ninfectious disease is measured in effective contacts per unit time. This may be\nexpressed as the 'total contact rate' (the total number of contacts, effective\nor not, per unit time, denoted Î³), multiplied by the risk of infection, given\ncontact between an infectious and a susceptible individual. This risk is called\nthe 'transmission risk' and is denoted p. Thus:\n\n:\n\\beta = \\gamma \\times p \\, \n\nThe total contact rate, Î³, will generally be greater than the effective contact\nrate, Î², since not all contacts result in infection. That is to say, p is almost\nalways less than 1 and it can never be greater than 1, since it is effectively\nthe probability of transmission occurring.\n\nThis relation formalises the fact that the effective contact rate depends not\nonly on the social patterns of contact in a particular society (Î³) but also on\nthe specific types of contact and the pathology of the infectious organism (p).\nFor example, it has been shown that a concurrent sexually transmitted infection\ncan substantially increase the probability (p) of infecting a susceptible with\nHIV. Therefore, one way to reduce the value of p (and hence lower HIV\ntransmission rates) might be to treat other sexually transmitted infections.\n\nThere are a number of difficulties in using this relation. The first is that it\nis very difficult to measure contact rates because they vary widely between\nindividuals and groups, and within the same group at different times. For\nsexually transmitted infections, large scale studies of sexual behaviour have\nbeen set up to estimate the contact rate. In developed countries for serious\ndiseases such as AIDS or tuberculosis, contact tracing is often carried out when\na patient is diagnosed (the patient and medical authorities try to inform every\npossible contact the patient may have made since infection). This, however, is\nnot so much a research tool and more to alert the contacts to the possibility\nthat they may be infected and so can seek medical treatment and avoiding passing\non the disease if they have contracted it.\n\nA second consideration is that it is generally thought unethical to carry out\ndirect experiments to establish per-contact infection risks as this would\nrequire the deliberate exposure of individuals to infectious agents. The Common\nCold Unit that researched cold transmission in the UK between 1946 and 1989 was\na notable exception. It is also possible to estimate the transmission risk in\ncertain circumstances where exposures to infection have been documented, for\nexample the rate of infection among nurses who have accidentally pricked their\nfingers with a needle that had previously been used with contaminated blood.\n\nA more direct assessment of transmission risks can be provided by a contact\nstudy, which is often carried out because of an outbreak (such a study was\ncarried out during the SARS outbreak of 2002–3). The first (or primary)\ncase within a defined group (such as a school or family) is identified and\npeople infected by this individual (called secondary cases) are documented. If\nthe number of susceptibles in the group is n and the number of secondary cases\nis x, then an estimation of the transmission risk is\n\n:\np = \\frac {x} {n}. \n\nHere, p is the same parameter as before but it has been calculated in a\ndifferent way. To reflect this, it is called the 'secondary attack rate' (it is\nreally a risk, of course, and not a rate, but the term is still commonly used).\n\nEven if the whole group in question is susceptible, x is generally smaller than\nthe basic reproduction number for the disease. That is defined as the number of\nindividuals each infected individual will go on to infect themselves, in a\npopulation with no resistance to the disease. The basic reproduction number\nincludes all secondary cases infected by a primary case, while x is only the\nnumber of secondary cases within the group in question.\n\nSecondary attack rates are useful for comparisons between vaccinated and\nunvaccinated groups and hence assessing the efficacy of vaccinations against\nthe disease under inspection. However, there are inevitably complications\nwith such contact studies. It is not always obvious which members of the\ngroup are susceptible and distinguishing between secondary and subsequent\ncases (for example, those infected by the secondary cases are tertiary cases\nand so on) can be difficult. Also, the possibility of infection from an\noutsider must be ignored.\n\nDespite these problems, the parameters p and Î² are powerful tools in the\nmathematical modelling of epidemics. But it should always be remembered that a\nmodel is only as good as the assumptions on which it is based and the data from\nwhich its parameters are calculated.\n","linknr":112,"url":"Transmission_risks_and_rates","recorded":1376428990,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Transmission_risks_and_rates&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Transmission_risks_and_rates&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_risks_and_rates","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transmission_risks_and_rates&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)","/wiki/Infection","/wiki/Infectious_disease","/wiki/Susceptible","/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)","/wiki/Population","/wiki/Infectious_disease","/wiki/Risk_of_infection","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/1/8/418f3274e3b7b3d3efdd2224c76d15b7.png","/wiki/Probability","/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease","/wiki/HIV","/wiki/Sexual_network","/wiki/AIDS","/wiki/Tuberculosis","/wiki/Medical_ethics","/wiki/Common_Cold_Unit","/w/index.php?title=Contact_study&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/SARS","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/7/d/27d7194cf0ac6f2a5426a5a7883dbd27.png","/wiki/Parameter","/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number","/wiki/Vaccination","/w/index.php?title=Transmission_risks_and_rates&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Transmission_risks_and_rates&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Mathematical_modelling_in_epidemiology","/wiki/Risk_factor","/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)","/wiki/Bugchasing_and_giftgiving","/wiki/Epidemic_model","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transmission_risks_and_rates&oldid=552137962","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Epidemiology","/wiki/Category:Medical_statistics","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_November_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Transmission+risks+and+rates&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Transmission+risks+and+rates","/wiki/Transmission_risks_and_rates","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transmission_risks_and_rates&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Transmission_risks_and_rates","/w/index.php?title=Transmission_risks_and_rates&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Transmission_risks_and_rates&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Transmission_risks_and_rates&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Transmission_risks_and_rates","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Transmission_risks_and_rates","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Transmission_risks_and_rates&oldid=552137962","/w/index.php?title=Transmission_risks_and_rates&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7834649","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Transmission_risks_and_rates&id=552137962","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Transmission+risks+and+rates","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Transmission+risks+and+rates&oldid=552137962&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Transmission_risks_and_rates&printable=yes","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmissierisico","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7834649#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wi
