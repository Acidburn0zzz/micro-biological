{"cursor":"9664","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":Not to be confused with the [[conical surface]]. For other uses, see [[Cone\n(disambiguation)]].\n\n\nA 'cone' is an n -dimensional geometric shape that tapers smoothly\nfrom a base (usually flat and circular) to a point called the apex or vertex.\n\nMore precisely, it is the solid figure bounded by a plane base and the surface\n(called the lateral surface) formed by the locus of all straight line segments\njoining the apex to the perimeter of the base. The term \"cone\" sometimes refers\njust to the surface of this solid figure, or just to the lateral surface.\n\nThe axis of a cone is the straight line (if any), passing through the apex,\nabout which the base has a rotational symmetry.\n\nIn common usage in elementary geometry, cones are assumed to be 'right\ncircular', where right means that the axis passes through the centre of the base\n(suitably defined) at right angles to its plane, and circular means that the\nbase is a circle. Contrasted with right cones are oblique cones, in which the\naxis does not pass perpendicularly through the centre of the base. In general, however, the base may be any shape, and the\napex may lie anywhere (though it is often assumed that the base is bounded and\ntherefore has finite area, and that the apex lies outside the plane of the\nbase). For example, a pyramid is technically a cone with a polygonal base.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"cone_(geometry)","recorded":1376427683,"links":[],"instances":["conic_section","geometry","topology","geometry","mathematics","geometry","geometry","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elementary shapes","Surfaces"],"headings":["Other mathematical meanings","Further terminology","Geometry","Projective geometry","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["apex","geometry"],["locus","mathematics"],["area","geometry"],["pyramid","geometry"],["set","mathematics"],["directrix","conic_section"],["cone","geometry_proofs"],["cylinder","geometry"],["cone","topology"]],"members":["directrix","area","cone","apex","locus","cylinder","pyramid","set"],"related":["Dimension","Geometric_shape","Apex_(geometry)","Locus_(mathematics)","Rotational_symmetry","Geometry","Perpendicular","Circle","Area_(geometry)","Pyramid_(geometry)","Polygon","Set_(mathematics)","Half-line","Straight_line","Conical_surface","Conic_section","Convex_cone","Projective_cone","Directrix_(conic_section)","Dandelin_spheres","Radius","Aperture","Frustum","Ellipse","Visual_hull","Cone_(geometry)_proofs","Lateral_surface","Pythagorean_theorem","Volume","Cavalieri's_principle","Method_of_exhaustion","Hilbert's_third_problem","Center_of_mass","Area","Slant_height","Implicit_function","Vector_calculus","Dot_product","Cylinder_(geometry)","Projective_geometry","Arctan","Right_angle","Degenerate_conic","Cylindrical_conic","Conic_section","Cone_(topology)","Democritus","Hyperboloid","Quadric","Ruled_surface","Pyrometric_cone","Math_Is_Fun"]}
