{"cursor":"6458","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"s. Stereochemistry focuses on stereoisomers]]\n\n'Stereochemistry', a subdiscipline of chemistry, involves the study of the\nrelative spatial arrangement of atoms that form the structure of molecules and\ntheir manipulation. An important branch of stereochemistry is the study of\nchiral molecules.\n\nStereochemistry is also known as 3D chemistry because the prefix \"stereo-\" means\n\"three-dimensionality\". http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stereo-\n\nThe study of stereochemistry focuses on stereoisomers and spans the entire\nspectrum of organic, inorganic, biological, physical and especially\nsupramolecular chemistry. Stereochemistry includes methods for determining and\ndescribing these relationships; the effect on the physical or biological\nproperties these relationships impart upon the molecules in question, and the\nmanner in which these relationships influence the reactivity of the molecules in\nquestion (dynamic stereochemistry).\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Stereochemistry","recorded":1376428509,"links":[],"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stereochemistry|","Chemistry"],"headings":["History and significance","Definitions","Types","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["chirality","chemistry"],["strain","chemistry#torsional_strain"],["chirality","chemistry"]],"members":["strain","chirality"],"related":["Stereoisomer","Chemistry","Atom","Molecule","Chirality_(chemistry)","Three-dimensional_space","Stereoisomers","Organic_chemistry","Inorganic_chemistry","Biochemistry","Physical_chemistry","Supramolecular_chemistry","Physics","Biology","Dynamic_stereochemistry","Louis_Pasteur","Salt","Tartaric_acid","Wine","Polarized_light","Optical_isomerism","Jacobus_Henricus_van_'t_Hoff","Joseph_Le_Bel","Cahn_Ingold_Prelog_priority_rules","Fischer_projection","Thalidomide","Medication","Germany","Pregnancy","Teratology","Genetics","Embryo","Baby","Biochemical_Pharmacology","Racemization","Cancer","Leprosy","IUPAC_Gold_Book","William_Klyne","Vladimir_Prelog","Klyne-Prelog_System","Torsion_angle","Atropisomerism","Cis-trans_isomerism","Conformational_isomerism","Diastereomers","Enantiomers","Rotamer","Alkane_stereochemistry","Chirality_(chemistry)","Solid-state_chemistry","VSEPR_Theory"]}
