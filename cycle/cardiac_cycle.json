Guyton, A.C. & Hall,\nJ.E. (2006) Textbook of Medical Physiology (11th ed.) Philadelphia: Elsevier\nSaunder ISBN 0-7216-0240-1 The frequency of the cardiac cycle is described\nby the heart rate. Each beat of the heart involves five major stages. The first\ntwo stages, often considered together as the \"ventricular filling\" stage,\ninvolve the movement of blood from atria into ventricles. The next three stages\ninvolve the movement of blood from the ventricles to the pulmonary artery (in\nthe case of the right ventricle) and the aorta (in the case of the left\nventricle).\n\nThe first, \"early diastole,\" is when the semilunar valves close, the\natrioventricular (AV) valves are open, and the whole heart is relaxed. The\nsecond, \"atrial systole,\" is when the atrium contracts, and blood flows from\natrium to the ventricle. The third, \"isovolumic ventricular contraction,\" is\nwhen the ventricles begin to contract, the AV and semilunar valves close, and\nthere is no change in volume. The fourth, \"ventricular ejection,\" is when the\nventricles are empty and contracting, and the semilunar valves are open. During\nthe fifth stage, \"Isovolumic ventricular relaxation,\" pressure decreases, no\nblood enters the ventricles, the ventricles stop contracting and begin to relax,\nand the semilunar valves close due to the pressure of blood in the aorta.\n\nThroughout the cardiac cycle, blood pressure increases and decreases. The\ncardiac cycle is coordinated by a series of electrical impulses that are\nproduced by specialized heart cells found within the sinoatrial node and the\natrioventricular node. The cardiac muscle is composed of myocytes which initiate\ntheir own contraction without help of external nerves (with the exception of\nmodifying the heart rate due to metabolic demand). Under normal circumstances,\neach cycle takes approximately one second.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"cardiac_cycle","recorded":1376428671,"links":[],"instances":["medicine","anatomy","heart","heart"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cardiovascular physiology"],"headings":["Anatomical basis of the cardiac cycle","Stages of the cardiac cycle","Atrial systole","Ventricular systole","Diastole","Regulation of the cardiac cycle","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["systole","medicine"],["organ","anatomy"],["atrium","heart"],["ventricle","heart"],["systole","medicine"],["atrium","heart"],["ventricle","heart"],["systole","medicine"],["ventricle","heart"]],"members":["systole","organ","ventricle","atrium"],"related":["Blood_pressure","Heart_sounds","Heart_rate","Diastole","Semilunar_valves","Heart_valve","Systole_(medicine)","Blood_pressure","Sinoatrial_node","Atrioventricular_node","Myocytes","Organ_(anatomy)","Atrium_(heart)","Ventricle_(heart)","Pulmonary","Systemic_circulation","Diastole","Systole_(medicine)","Myocytes","Mitral_valve","Tricuspid_valve","Aortic_valve","Aorta","Pulmonic_valve","Pulmonary_artery","Atrium_(heart)","Myocardium","Atrial_fibrillation","Atrial_flutter","Third_degree_heart_block","Electrocardiogram","Ventricle_(heart)","Inertial_wave","Aortic_valve","Pulmonary_valve","Left_bundle_branch_block","Electrocardiogram","QRS_complex","Systole_(medicine)","Mitral_valve","Isovolumic_relaxation_time","Heart_sound","Aortic_valve","Tricuspid_valve","Coronary_arteries","Cardiac_muscle_automaticity","Myogenic_contraction","Skeletal_muscle","Sympathetic_nerve","Vagus_nerve","Sinoatrial","Atrioventricular_node","Action_potential","Purkinje_fibers","Apex_beat","Blood_pressure","Cardiac_action_potential","Cardiac_muscle","Cardiac_output","Electrocardiogram","Heart","Ventricle_(heart)"]}
