The WWF ecoregions are classified by biome type (Tropical and\nsubtropical moist broadleaf forests, Temperate grasslands, savannas, and\nshrublands, tundra, etc.), and into one of eight terrestrial ecozones.\nAustralia, together with New Zealand, New Guinea and neighboring island groups,\nis part of the Australasia ecozone. The IBRA bioregions informed the delineation\nof the WWF ecoregions for Australia, and the WWF ecoregions generally follow the\nsame ecoregion boundaries, while often clustering two or more similar bioregions\ninto a larger ecoregion. The ecoregion articles in Wikipedia generally follow\nthe WWF scheme.\n\nThe WWF ecoregions are based heavily upon the Interim Biogeographic\nRegionalisation for Australia (IBRA) regionalisation. Like the IBRA, it was\ndeveloped for use as a planning tool for conservation science, with the goal of\nestablishing a system of nature reserves in each of the ecoregions or bioregions\nsufficient to preserve biodiversity. Both systems also have a prioritization\nsystem for establishing preserves; the WWF designated its Global 200 ecoregions\nas priorities for conservation, and the Department of Environment and Heritage\nranks its bioregions high, medium, or low priority, based on \"the potential\nvalue land reservation in those regions would add to the development of a\ncomprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system for Australia.\"\n","linknr":-1,"url":"ecoregions_in_Australia","recorded":1376429214,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ecoregions of Australia|","Ecoregions of Oceania","Australasian ecozone","Lists of biota of Australia|","Lists of ecoregions by country|Australia"],"headings":["WWF Ecoregions","See also"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature","Biome","Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests","Temperate_grasslands,_savannas,_and_shrublands","Tundra","Ecozone","New_Zealand","New_Guinea","Australasia_ecozone","Interim_Biogeographic_Regionalisation_for_Australia","Global_200","Lord_Howe_Island","Norfolk_Island","Queensland_tropical_rain_forests","Eastern_Australian_temperate_forests","Southeast_Australia_temperate_forests","Tasmanian_Central_Highland_forests","Tasmanian_temperate_forests","Tasmanian_temperate_rain_forests","Arnhem_Land_tropical_savanna","Brigalow_tropical_savanna","Cape_York_tropical_savanna","Carpentaria_tropical_savanna","Einasleigh_upland_savanna","Kimberly_tropical_savanna","Mitchell_grass_downs","Victoria_Plains_tropical_savanna","Eastern_Australia_mulga_shrublands","Southeast_Australia_temperate_savanna","Australian_Alps_montane_grasslands","Antipodes_Subantarctic_Islands_tundra","Australia","New_Zealand","Coolgardie_woodlands","Esperance_mallee","Eyre_and_York_mallee","Jarrah-Karri_forest_and_shrublands","Kwongan","Mount_Lofty_woodlands","Murray-Darling_woodlands_and_mallee","Naracoorte_woodlands","Southwest_Australia_savanna","Southwest_Australia_woodlands","Carnarvon_xeric_shrublands","Central_Ranges_xeric_scrub","Gibson_Desert","Great_Sandy_Desert","Tanami_Desert","Great_Victoria_Desert","Nullarbor_Plain_xeric_shrublands","Pilbara_shrublands","Simpson_Desert","Tirari-Sturt_Stony_Desert","Western_Australian_mulga_shrublands","Environment_of_Australia"]}
