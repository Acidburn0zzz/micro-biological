{"cursor":"5394","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Gerd B. MÃ¼ller (born April 17, 1953 in Salzburg, Austria) is professor at the\nUniversity of Vienna where he heads the Department of Theoretical Biology and is\nspeaker of the Center for Organismal Systems Biology. His research interests\nfocus on evolutionary innovation, evo-devo theory, and the extension of the\nEvolutionary Synthesis. He is also concerned with the development of micro-CT\nbased quantitative tools in developmental biology.\n\nMÃ¼ller received an M.D. in 1979 and a Ph.D. in zoology in 1985, both from the\nUniversity of Vienna. He has been a sabbatical fellow at the Department of\nDevelopmental Biology, Dalhousie University, Canada (1988) and a visiting\nscholar at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University (1988â89). He\nis a founding member of the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition\nResearch, Altenberg, Austria, of which he is chairman since 1998. MÃ¼ller is on\nthe editorial boards of several scientific journals, including Biological\nTheory where he serves as an Associate Editor. He is also editor (together with\nGÃ¼nter Wagner and Werner Callebaut) of the Vienna Series in Theoretical\nBiology, a book series devoted to theoretical developments in the biosciences,\npublished by MIT Press.\n\nWith the cell and developmental biologist Stuart Newman, MÃ¼ller co-edited the\nbook Origination of Organismal Form (MIT Press, 2003). This book on evolutionary\ndevelopmental biology is a collection of papers on generative mechanisms that\nwere plausibly involved in the origination of disparate body forms during the\nEdiacaran and early Cambrian periods. Particular attention is given to\nepigenetic factors, such as physical determinants and environmental parameters,\nthat may have led to the spontaneous emergence of bodyplans and organ forms\nduring a period when multicellular organisms had relatively plastic\nmorphologies. Natural selection acting on variant genotypes is suggested to have\nthen \"locked in\" these body plans.\n","linknr":129,"url":"Gerd_MÃ¼ller_(theoretical_biologist)","recorded":1376422935,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Salzburg","/wiki/Austria","/wiki/University_of_Vienna","/wiki/Theoretical_Biology","/wiki/Systems_Biology","/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology","/wiki/History_of_evolutionary_thought","/wiki/Microtomography","/wiki/Dalhousie_University","/wiki/Museum_of_Comparative_Zoology","/wiki/Harvard_University","/wiki/Konrad_Lorenz_Institute_for_Evolution_and_Cognition_Research","/wiki/Biological_Theory","/wiki/G%C3%BCnter_Wagner","/wiki/Vienna_Series_in_Theoretical_Biology","/wiki/MIT_Press","/wiki/Stuart_Newman","/wiki/Origination_of_Organismal_Form","/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology","/wiki/Ediacaran","/wiki/Cambrian_explosion","/wiki/Epigenetic_Theory","/wiki/Bodyplan","/wiki/Phenotypic_plasticity","/wiki/Natural_selection","#Edited_books","#Selected_articles","#See_also","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)&veaction=edit&section=1","http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=12173","http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=11248","http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=9988","/wiki/Origination_of_Organismal_Form","/w/index.php?title=Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)&veaction=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)&veaction=edit&section=3","http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/321/5886/196","http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080917/full/455281a.html","/w/index.php?title=Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)&veaction=edit&section=4","http://homepage.univie.ac.at/gerhard.mueller/","http://www.univie.ac.at/theoretical/","http://www.univie.ac.at/Lebenswissenschaften/OrgSysBiol/osbiol.html","http://kli.ac.at/","http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?sid=B5C39998-812F-4084-8F62-E95ECF623F17&btype=6&serid=102","http://www.springer.com/philosophy/epistemology+and+philosophy+of+science/journal/13752","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gerd_Müller_(theoretical_biologist)&oldid=548106570","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1953_births","/wiki/Category:Theoretical_biologists","/wiki/Category:University_of_Vienna_alumni","/wiki/Category:University_of_Vienna_faculty","/wiki/Category:Harvard_University_staff","/wiki/Category:Evolutionary_biologists","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gerd+M%C3%BCller+%28theoretical+biologist%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gerd+M%C3%BCller+%28theoretical+biologist%29","/wiki/Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)","/wiki/Talk:Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)","#","/wiki/Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)","/w/index.php?title=Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gerd_M%C3%BCller_(theoretical_biologist)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate
