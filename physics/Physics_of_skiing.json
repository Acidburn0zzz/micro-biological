{"cursor":"4081","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The physics of skiing refers to the analysis of the forces acting on a person\nwhile skiing.\n\nThe motion of a skier is determined by the physical principles of the\nconservation of energy and the frictional forces acting on the body. For\nexample, in downhill skiing, as the skier is accelerated down the hill by the\nforce of gravity, her gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic\nenergy, the energy of motion. In the ideal case, all of the potential energy\nwould be converted into kinetic energy; in reality, some of the energy is lost\nto heat due to friction.\n\nOne type of friction acting on the skier is the kinetic friction between the\nskis and snow. The force of friction acts in the direction opposite to the\ndirection of motion, resulting in a lower velocity and hence less kinetic\nenergy. The kinetic friction can be reduced by applying wax to the bottom of the\nskis which reduces the coefficient of friction. Different types of wax are\nmanufactured for different temperature ranges because the snow quality changes\ndepending on the current weather conditions and thermal history of the snow. The\nshape and construction material of a ski can also greatly impact the forces\nacting on a skier. D. A. Lind and S. P. Sanders. The Physics of Skiing.\nSkiing at the Triple Point. Springer, New York (2003). Skis designed for\nuse in powder condition are very different from skis designed for use on groomed\ntrails. These design differences can be attributed to the differences in the\nsnow quality.\n\nAn illustration of how snow quality can be different follows. In an area which\nexperiences fluctuation in temperatures around 0Â°C - freezing temperature of\nwater, both rain and snowfall are possible. Wet snow or the wet ground can\nfreeze into a slippery sheet of ice. In an area which consistently experiences\ntemperatures below 0Â°C, snowfall leads to accumulation of snow on the ground.\nWhen fresh, this snow is fluffy and powder-like. This type of snow has a lot of\nair space. Over time, this snow will become more compact, and the lower layers\nof snow will become more dense than the top layer. Skiers can use this type of\ninformation to improve their skiing experience by choosing the appropriate skis,\nwax, or by choosing to stay home. Search and rescue teams, and backcountry users\nrely on our understanding of snow to navigate the dangers present in the outdoors. http://www.avalanche.ca/cac/training/online-course/avalanche-\nformation\n\nThe second type of frictional force acting on a skier is drag. This is typically\nreferred to as \"air resistance\". The drag force is proportional to the cross-\nsectional area of a body (e.g. the skier) and the square of its velocity and\ndensity relative to the fluid in which the body is traveling though (e.g. air).\nTo go faster, a skier can try to reduce the cross-sectional area of their body.\nDownhill skiers can adopt more aerodynamic positions such as tucking. Alpine ski\nracers wear skin tight race suits. The general area of physics which addresses\nthese forces is known as fluid dynamics.\n","linknr":106,"url":"Physics_of_skiing","recorded":1376423912,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Physics_of_skiing&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Physics_of_skiing&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_of_skiing","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Force","/wiki/Skiing","/wiki/File:Skiing_Christmas_%2705_034.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Skiing_Christmas_%2705_034.jpg/392px-Skiing_Christmas_%2705_034.jpg","/wiki/File:Skiing_Christmas_%2705_034.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Potential_energy","/wiki/Kinetic_energy","/wiki/Friction","/wiki/Kinetic_friction","/wiki/Coefficient_of_friction","/wiki/Wax","/wiki/Ski","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Snowpack","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Drag","/wiki/Air_resistance","/wiki/Fluid_dynamics","/w/index.php?title=Physics_of_skiing&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Physics_of_skiing&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://www.avalanche.ca/cac/training/online-course/avalanche-formation","/w/index.php?title=Physics_of_skiing&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Physics_of_skiing&veaction=edit&section=2","http://library.thinkquest.org/C003978/physics.html","http://www.math.utah.edu/~eyre/rsbfaq/physics.html","http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:arXiv.org:physics/0310086","http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/structures/weights.html","/wiki/Snowpack","/wiki/Avalanche_Skills_Training","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physics_of_skiing&oldid=563880145","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Mechanics","/wiki/Category:Biomechanics","/wiki/Category:Skiing","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Physics+of+skiing&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Physics+of+skiing","/wiki/Physics_of_skiing","/wiki/Talk:Physics_of_skiing","#","/wiki/Physics_of_skiing","/w/index.php?title=Physics_of_skiing&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Physics_of_skiing&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Physics_of_skiing&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Physics_of_skiing","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Physics_of_skiing","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Physics_of_skiing&oldid=563880145","/w/index.php?title=Physics_of_skiing&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7189701","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Physics_of_skiing&id=563880145","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Physics+of+skiing","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Physics+of+skiing&oldid=563880145&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Physics_of_skiing&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%A1_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B2%D9%84%D8%AC","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7189701#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_of_skiing","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.
