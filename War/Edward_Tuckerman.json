He was a founding member of the\nNatural History Society of Boston and most of his career was spent at Amherst\nCollege. He did the majority of his collecting on the slopes of Mount Washington\nin the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Tuckerman Ravine was named in his\nhonor. The standard botanical author abbreviation 'Tuck.' is applied to species\nhe described.\n\nTuckerman was the eldest son of a Boston merchant, also Edward Tuckerman, and\nSophia (May) Tuckerman. He studied at Boston Latin School and then at his\nfather's urging at Union College in Schenectady, which he entered as a\nsophomore and where he completed a BA in 1837 and to which he returned for his\nMA after taking a Law degree at Harvard in 1839, traveling in Germany and\nScandinavia, and making the first of his botanical studies in the White\nMountains. Asa Gray, \"Edward Tuckerman,\" Proceedings of the American\nAcademy of Arts and Sciences 21 (1885-86) 539-47, repr. in Charles Sprague\nSargent, ed., Scientific Papers of Asa Gray volume 2, pp. 491-98, [http://book-\ns.google.com/books?id=3_hGAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA491&dq=Scientific+Papers+of+Asa+Gray+S-\nargent++Tuckerman&hl=en&ei=qx-\nmS_WcDYH7lwea6ZGbAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAA#v=o-\nnepage&q=&f=false p. 491]. In 1846 he returned to Harvard as a senior\n(telling the President he intended to correct his father's error in breaking\nthe family tradition), completed a second BA in 1847, then two or three years\nlater entered the Divinity School and graduated from there in 1852. Gray,\npp. 491-92.\n\nAfter teaching at Union College, Tuckerman was a professor at Amherst College\nfrom 1854 until his death, successively Lecturer in History,\nProfessor of Oriental History, and from 1858 Professor of Botany.

Amherst awarded him an LLD. Gray, p.\n492.\n\nHis first paper, on New England lichens, was given in 1838 or 1839. In 1843 he published privately the first serious\nsystematic analysis of the genus [[Carex]], Enumeratio Methodica Caricum\nQuarundam. Tuckerman liked to write his botanical studies in Latin. Gray, p. 493. He also made the first\nsystematic study of native [[Potamogeton]], and after becoming Professor of\nBotany at Amherst, began preparing A Catalogue of Plants Growing without\ncultivation within 30 miles of Amherst College (published in 1875). However, his main focus was lichens. He published a number\nof important studies in the field, drawing on both his own collecting and\nspecimens sent to him from elsewhere, in particular by Charles Wright from\nCuba. Gray, p. 494: \"from the Rocky Mountains, Texas, the Pacific coast, the\nSandwich Islands [Hawai'i], and especially . . . the rich collections gathered\nin Cuba and elsewhere by the late Charles Wright.\" His career culminated\nin the publication of Genera Lichenum: An Arrangement of the North American\nLichens (1872) and Synopsis of the North American Lichens, Part 1\n(1882). Gray, pp. 494-95. His last botanical publication was in 1884,\nand he may have published anonymous theological articles after that. Gray,\np. 497. Tuckerman did not accept that lichens are a combination of fungi\nand algae, a theory advanced late in his life. Gray, p. 496.\n\nTuckerman was married to Sarah, daughter of Thomas Parkman Cushing, who was his\nfather's business partner.
