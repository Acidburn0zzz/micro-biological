His\nearly working career was in electronics, but for many years he has studied birds\nand also works as a professional guide for birding tours of the island.\n\nHe discovered a new species of bird endemic to Sri Lanka, the Serendib Scops\nOwl. His expertise in vocalizations had enabled him to realize that an owl he\nheard calling near Kitulgala was an unknown species, and he later saw this bird\nin January 2001 in the Sinharaja rainforest. Warakagoda, D. H. & Rasmussen,\nP. C. (1998) \"[http://www.birdandwildlifeteam.com/downloads/30.pdf A new species\nof scops owl from Sri Lanka]\". Bull. Brit. Orn. Club '124': 85â105 (It may\nbe relevant to note here that the validity of the Serendib Scops Owl as a \"New\"\nspecies has been called into question unsuccessfully in two papers by some\npeople who could not understand about the Sri Lankan owls! Refer to http://www.fogsl.net/Prod/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Serendib-Owl-\n1.pdf. and http://www.fogsl.net/Prod/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Serendib-Owl-\n2.pdf.)\n\nHe has also identified (each for the first time) 15 new migrant species of birds\nin Sri Lanka, and has published a large number of articles on the avifauna of\nSri Lanka.\n\nWarakgoda is Sri Lanka's foremost sound recordist in natural history subjects,\nand has produced and published the only comprehensive audio guide to the\nisland's birds (on tape and CD). He has an unmatched knowledge of Sri Lanka's\nbird songs and calls. His recordings of the island's distinct bird species have\nplayed a major role in the recognition of several of them as endemic to Sri\nLanka in the book [[Birds of South Asia. The Ripley Guide]] (2005) by Pamela C.\nRasmussen and John C. Anderton.\n\nAlthough best known for his knowledge of the avifauna of Sri Lanka, and\nexpertise in finding and identifying birds, his knowledge extends to the\nisland's mammals and butterflies.\n\nWarakagoda founded the Drongo Nature Sounds Library, the only one of its kind\nin Sri Lanka, and is joint secretary of the Ceylon Bird Club. He is a\nnational coordinator in Sri Lanka for the Asian Waterbird Census. He is a\nfounder of Bird and Wildlife Team [www.birdandwildlifeteam.com], a company\nspecializing in natural history tours of Sri Lanka and India, and works as\none of its tour leaders.\n\nHe is currently working on several new publications in the print and audio/video\nmedia, including Field Guide to the Birds of Sri Lanka, of which he is co-author\nwith three authorities on the avifauna of Asia.\n","linknr":99,"url":"Deepal_Warakagoda","recorded":1376425260,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Deepal_Warakagoda&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Deepal_Warakagoda&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepal_Warakagoda","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Sri_Lanka","/wiki/Ornithology","/wiki/Serendib_Scops_Owl","/wiki/Kitulgala","/wiki/Sinharaja_Forest_Reserve","#cite_note-1","http://www.fogsl.net/Prod/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Serendib-Owl-1.pdf","http://www.fogsl.net/Prod/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Serendib-Owl-2.pdf","/wiki/Birds_of_South_Asia._The_Ripley_Guide","/wiki/Pamela_C._Rasmussen","/wiki/John_C._Anderton","/w/index.php?title=Deepal_Warakagoda&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Deepal_Warakagoda&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0195638131","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1859745113","/w/index.php?title=Deepal_Warakagoda&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Deepal_Warakagoda&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.birdandwildlifeteam.com/downloads/30.pdf","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/120180505","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deepal_Warakagoda&oldid=546169590","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1965_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Sri_Lankan_ornithologists","/wiki/Category:Sri_Lankan_scientists","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Deepal+Warakagoda&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Deepal+Warakagoda","/wiki/Deepal_Warakagoda","/wiki/Talk:Deepal_Warakagoda","#","/wiki/Deepal_Warakagoda","/w/index.php?title=Deepal_Warakagoda&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Deepal_Warakagoda&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Deepal_Warakagoda&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Deepal_Warakagoda","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Deepal_Warakagoda","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Deepal_Warakagoda&oldid=546169590","/w/index.php?title=Deepal_Warakagoda&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5250547","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Deepal_Warakagoda&id=546169590","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Deepal+Warakagoda","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Deepal+Warakagoda&oldid=546169590&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Deepal_Warakagoda&printable=yes","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepal_Warakagoda","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5250547#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepal_Warakagoda","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.fogsl.net/Prod/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Ser
