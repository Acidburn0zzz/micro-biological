He studied at Stoke Poges,\nEton and Mason Science College (the forerunner of the\nUniversity of Birmingham), and eventually worked as a\ndirector of a major steelworks in Worcester.\n\nHe showed from his earliest childhood an intense love of natural history. It was\nnot until 1914 that his first work, British Warblers, was fully published,\nhaving been issued in parts since 1907. Continually working\non the theory of territory, he published Territory in Bird Life, illustrated by\nGeorge Edward Lodge and Henrik GrÃ¶nvold, in 1920 (a reissue in 1948 had an\nintroduction by Julian Huxley and James Fisher), followed by An Introduction to\nthe Study of Bird Behaviour, Nature of a Bird's World and lastly A Waterhen's\nWorld, in 1940. His books were published under the name \"Eliot Howard\".\n\nHe was a Justice of the Peace and for forty-five\nyears a member of the British Ornithologists' Union.\n\nAlthough his home was always in Worcestershire, much of his time was spent on\nthe wild coast of Donegal and in the north west of Ireland, shooting, fishing\nand studying natural history. He died at his home, Clareland, Stourport-on-\nSevern. He was attracted to the wild and beautiful area of Horn Head in the\nNorth West of Donegal, close to the Atlantic ocean, through his marriage in 1900\nto Anne Elizabeth Frances Stewart whose family had lived there for many years\n(the 1901 census of Ireland shows his wife was born in Donegal).\n\nHis father, Henry was a manufacturing chemist and was son of John Eliot Howard.\nJohn's father was Luke Howard. The 1901 Census shows Henry Eiot as a, 'Iron tube\nmanufacterer'.\n\nHis daughter, Esme Eleanor Howard, married the Reverend John William Fletcher\nBoughey, son of the Reverend Percy Fletcher Boughey and Elsie de Strange\nHerring, on 25 April 1940.\n","linknr":150,"url":"Henry_Eliot_Howard","recorded":1376425333,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Henry_Eliot_Howard&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Eliot_Howard&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Eliot_Howard","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Kidderminster","/wiki/Worcestershire","/wiki/Stourport-on-Severn","/wiki/Eton_College","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/Mason_Science_College","/wiki/Birmingham","/wiki/Ornithology","#Bibliography","#cite_note-CDoSB-1","#cite_note-CDoSB-1","/wiki/Ornithologist","/wiki/Territoriality","#cite_note-CDoSB-1","/wiki/Kidderminster","#cite_note-CDoSB-1","/wiki/Stoke_Poges","/wiki/Eton_College","#cite_note-CDoSB-1","/wiki/Mason_Science_College","/wiki/University_of_Birmingham","#cite_note-CDoSB-1","#cite_note-CDoSB-1","/wiki/Natural_history","#cite_note-CDoSB-1","/wiki/Territory_(animal)","/wiki/George_Edward_Lodge","/wiki/Henrik_Gr%C3%B6nvold","/wiki/Julian_Huxley","/wiki/James_Fisher_(naturalist)","/wiki/Justice_of_the_Peace","#cite_note-Peerage17472-2","/wiki/British_Ornithologists%27_Union","#cite_note-CDoSB-1","/wiki/Worcestershire","/wiki/Donegal","/wiki/Stourport-on-Severn","/wiki/John_Eliot_Howard","/wiki/Luke_Howard","#cite_note-Peerage17472-2","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Eliot_Howard&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Eliot_Howard&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/The_Zoologist","/wiki/John_Murray_(publisher)","/wiki/Cambridge_University_Press","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Eliot_Howard&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Eliot_Howard&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-CDoSB_1-0","#cite_ref-CDoSB_1-1","#cite_ref-CDoSB_1-2","#cite_ref-CDoSB_1-3","#cite_ref-CDoSB_1-4","#cite_ref-CDoSB_1-5","#cite_ref-CDoSB_1-6","#cite_ref-CDoSB_1-7","#cite_ref-CDoSB_1-8","#cite_ref-CDoSB_1-9","http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830905767.html","#cite_ref-Peerage17472_2-0","#cite_ref-Peerage17472_2-1","http://thepeerage.com/p17472.htm","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/58609077","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Kidderminster","/wiki/Worcestershire","/wiki/Stourport-on-Severn","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry_Eliot_Howard&oldid=555003424","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1873_births","/wiki/Category:1940_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_ornithologists","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Eton_College","/wiki/Category:People_from_Kidderminster","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_the_University_of_Birmingham","/wiki/Category:English_nature_writers","/wiki/Category:Infobox_person_using_influence","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Henry+Eliot+Howard&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Henry+Eliot+Howard","/wiki/Henry_Eliot_Howard","/wiki/Talk:Henry_Eliot_Howard","#","/wiki/Henry_Eliot_Howard","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Eliot_Howard&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Eliot_Howard&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Eliot_Howard&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Henry_Eliot_Howard","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Henry_Eliot_Howard","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Eliot_Howard&oldid=555003424","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Eliot_Howard&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3051046","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Henry_Eliot_Howard&id=5
