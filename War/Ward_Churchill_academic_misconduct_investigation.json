On May 16,\n2006, the investigative committee released its findings that Churchill had\nengaged in academic misconduct and had been \"disrespectful of Indian oral tradi-\ntions.\" [http://www.colorado.edu/news/reports/churchill/churchillreport0516-\n06.html \"Report of the Investigative Committee of the Standing Committee on\nResearch Misconduct at the University of Colorado at Boulder concerning\nAllegations of Academic Misconduct against Professor Ward Churchill\"].\nColorado.edu.\n\nThe University's Standing Committee on Research Misconduct voted that Churchill\nshould be dismissed. Chancellor Phil DiStefano then recommended to the\nUniversity's Board of Regents that Churchill be dismissed. After an\ninvestigation of Churchill's past research, Churchill was fired by the\nUniversity on July 24, 2007 for research misconduct, including plagiarism,\nfabrication, and falsification. {{Cite book\n| title = Report of the Investigative Committee of the Standing Committee on\n| Research Misconduct at the University of Colorado at Boulder concerning\n| Allegations of Academic Misconduct against Professor Ward Churchill first1 =\n| Marianne | last1 = Wesson first2 = Robert | last2 = Clinton first3 = JosÃ© |\n| last3 = LimÃ³n first4 = Marjorie | last4 = McIntosh first5 = Michael | last5 =\n| Radelet year = 2006 month = May 9 publisher = University of Colorado at\n| Boulder url = http://www.colorado.edu/news/reports/churchill/download/WardChu-\n| rchillReport.pdf\n|format=PDF}} {{cite web\n| title =Ward Churchill The Research Misconduct Inquiry work = colorado.edu url\n| =http://www.colorado.edu/news/reports/churchill/ accessdate=July 3, 2006\n}}\n\nSubsequent to his firing, Churchill sued the University for damages and\nreinstatement. According to Churchill's lawyer, \"the search for professional\nmisconduct was simply a pretext for a foregone decision to get rid of him.\" On\nApril 1, 2009, a Colorado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired. At\nthe verdict, Churchill's counsel asked Judge Larry J. Naves of Denver District\nCourt to order reinstatement, in light of the verdict.\nOn July 7, 2009, Naves vacated the monetary award and declined Churchill's\nrequest to order his reinstatement, deciding the university has \"quasi-judicial\nimmunity\". On February 18, 2010, Churchill appealed the judges decision.
