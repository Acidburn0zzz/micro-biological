Dalton's main fields of interest concerned the\nphysiology, genetics and biochemistry of organisms exhibiting methanotrophy. One\nof his main research interests was the particulate methane monooxygenase enzyme.\nHis model organisms included [[Methylococcus capsulatus]] (Bath) and\n[[Methylosinus trichosporium]] OB3b.\n\nHe served as Chair of Biological Sciences at Warwick from 1999 to 2002 before\nbeing appointed to DEFRA.
