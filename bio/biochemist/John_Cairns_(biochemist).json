He then worked as a virologist at the\nWalter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, Australia and\nat the Virus Research Institute at Entebbe, Uganda. He returned to Australia to\nwork at in the School of Microbiology at the John Curtin School of Medical\nResearch. Cairns took a sabbatical to research at the Cold Spring Harbor\nLaboratory between 1960 and 1961, and returned there to serve as the director\nfrom 1963 to 1968. He remained a staff member at Cold Spring Harbor until 1972,\nwhen he was appointed head of the Mill Hill Laboratory of the Imperial Cancer\nResearch Fund. After leaving Mill Hill in 1980 he took up a professorship at the\nHarvard School of Public Health. He retired in 1991.\n\nIn his 1963 paper \"The bacterial chromosome and its manner of replication as\nseen by autoradiography\", Cairns demonstrated by autoradiography that the DNA of\nthe bacterium [[Escherichia coli]] was a single molecule that is replicated at a\nmoving locus (the replicating fork) at which both new DNA strands are being\nsynthesized. Subsequently, it was found that there were in fact two moving\nforks, traveling simultaneously in opposite directions around the chromosome.\n\nIn 1974 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1981, John Cairns\nreceived a MacArthur Foundation (\"genius\") Fellowship. He is the author of the\n1978 book Cancer: Science and Society (now out of print) and the 1997 book,\nMatters of Life and Death: Perspectives on Public Health, Molecular Biology,\nCancer, and the Prospects for the Human Race. Together with James Watson and\nGunther Stent, Cairns also edited the collection of historical accounts Phage\nand the Origins of Molecular Biology.\n","linknr":112,"url":"John_Cairns_(biochemist)","recorded":1376425943,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_Cairns_(biochemist)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Cairns_(biochemist)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cairns_(biochemist)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Molecular_genetics","/wiki/Cancer_research","/wiki/Public_health","/wiki/Oxford","/wiki/Walter_and_Eliza_Hall_Institute_of_Medical_Research","/wiki/Melbourne,_Australia","/wiki/Entebbe","/wiki/John_Curtin_School_of_Medical_Research","/wiki/Cold_Spring_Harbor_Laboratory","/wiki/Mill_Hill","/wiki/Imperial_Cancer_Research_Fund","/wiki/Harvard_School_of_Public_Health","/wiki/Autoradiography","/wiki/DNA","/wiki/Bacterium","/wiki/Escherichia_coli","/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","/wiki/MacArthur_Foundation","/wiki/James_D._Watson","/wiki/Gunther_Stent","/w/index.php?title=John_Cairns_(biochemist)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=John_Cairns_(biochemist)&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Theta_structure","/w/index.php?title=John_Cairns_(biochemist)&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=John_Cairns_(biochemist)&veaction=edit&section=2","http://oralhistory.cshl.edu/mainMovie.html","/w/index.php?title=John_Cairns_(biochemist)&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=John_Cairns_(biochemist)&veaction=edit&section=3","http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1980/A1980JY54900001.pdf#search=%22John%20Cairns%20DNA%22","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/16/10567","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Cairns_(biochemist)&oldid=546632088","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1922_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Harvard_University_staff","/wiki/Category:British_molecular_biologists","/wiki/Category:British_geneticists","/wiki/Category:Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society","/wiki/Category:MacArthur_Fellows","/wiki/Category:Walter_and_Eliza_Hall_Institute_of_Medical_Research_alumni","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Cairns+%28biochemist%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Cairns+%28biochemist%29","/wiki/John_Cairns_(biochemist)","/wiki/Talk:John_Cairns_(biochemist)","#","/wiki/John_Cairns_(biochemist)","/w/index.php?title=John_Cairns_(biochemist)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Cairns_(biochemist)&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Cairns_(biochemist)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/John_Cairns_(biochemist)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/John_Cairns_(biochemist)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=John_Cairns_(biochemist)&oldid=546632088","/w/index.php?title=John_Cairns_(biochemist)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1699519","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=John_Cairns_%28biochemist%29&id=546632088","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=John+Cairns+%28biochemist%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=John+Cairns+%28biochemist%29&oldid=546632088&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=John_Cairns_(biochemist)&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cairns_(Biologe)","//eu.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cairns","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1699519#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License
