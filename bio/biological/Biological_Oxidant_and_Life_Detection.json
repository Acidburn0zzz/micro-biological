The BOLD mission objective would be to quantify the amount of\nhydrogen peroxide () existing in the Martian soil and to test for processes\ntypically associated with life. Six landing packages are projected to impact\n'softly' on Mars that include a limited power supply, a set of oxidant and life\ndetection experiments, and a transmitter, which is able to transmit information\nvia an existing Mars orbiter back to Earth.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Biological_Oxidant_and_Life_Detection","recorded":1376429106,"links":[],"instances":["spacecraft","planet"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Missions to Mars","Unmanned spacecraft","Proposed spacecraft","Astrobiology"],"headings":["Overview","Scientific objectives","Lander probes","Instrument payload","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["life_on_mars","planet"],["life_on_mars","planet"],["phoenix","spacecraft"],["phoenix","spacecraft"]],"members":["phoenix","life_on_mars"],"related":["NASA","Mars","Mars","Biosignature","Life_on_Mars_(planet)","Hydrogen_peroxide","Viking_program","Life_on_Mars_(planet)","Planetary_habitability","Phoenix_(spacecraft)","Mars_Science_Laboratory","ExoMars","Viking_program","Lithotroph","Phototroph","Biosignature","ExoMars","Geology_of_Mars","Icebreaker_Life","Mars_Science_Laboratory","Phoenix_(spacecraft)","Viking_biological_experiments"]}
