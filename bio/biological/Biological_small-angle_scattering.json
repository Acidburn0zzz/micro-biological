Small-angle scattering allows one\nto study the structure of a variety of objects such as solutions of biological\nmacromolecules, nanocomposites, alloys, synthetic polymers, etc. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small-angle\nneutron scattering (SANS) are the two complementary techniques known jointly as\nsmall-angle scattering (SAS). SAS is an analogous method to X-ray and neutron\ndiffraction, wide angle X-ray scattering, as well as to static light scattering.\nIn separation to the other X-ray and neutron scattering methods, SAS yields\ninformation on the sizes and shapes of both crystalline and non-crystalline\nparticles. When used to study biological materials, which are very often in\naqueous solution, the scattering pattern is orientation averaged.\n\n\nSAS patterns are collected at very small angles (a few degrees). SAS is capable\nof delivering structural information in the resolution range between 1 and 25\nnm, and of repeat distances in partially ordered systems of up to 150Â nm in\nsize. Ultra small-angle scattering ('USAS') can resolve even larger dimensions.\nThe grazing-incidence small-angle scattering ('GISAS') is a powerful technique\nfor studying of biological molecule layers on surfaces.\n\nIn biological applications SAS is used to determine the structure of a particle\nin terms of average particle size and shape. One can also get information on the\nsurface-to-volume ratio. Typically, the biological macromolecules are dispersed\nin a liquid. The method is accurate, mostly non-destructive and usually requires\nonly a minimum of sample preparation. Although, biological molecules are always\nsusceptible to radiation damage.\n\nConceptually, small-angle scattering experiments are simple: the sample is\nexposed to X-rays or neutrons and the scattered radiation is registered by a\ndetector. As the SAS measurements are performed very close to the primary beam\n(\"small angles\"), the technique needs a highly collimated or focused X-ray or\nneutron beam. The biological small-angle X-ray scattering is often performed at\nsynchrotron radiation sources, because biological molecules normally scatter\nweakly and the measured solutions are dilute. The biological SAXS method profits\nfrom the high intensity of X-ray photon beams provided by the synchrotron\nstorage rings. The X-ray or neutron scattering curve (intensity versus\nscattering angle) is used to create a low-resolution model of a protein, shown\nhere on the right picture. One can further use the X-ray or neutron scattering\ndata and fit separate domains (X-ray or NMR structures) into the \"SAXS\nenvelope\".\n\nIn comparison to other structure determination methods, such as NMR or X-ray\ncrystallography, SAS allows one to overcome some restraints. For example, NMR is\nlimited to protein size, whereas SAS can be used for small molecules as well as\nfor large multi-molecular assemblies. Structure determination by X-ray\ncrystallography may take several weeks or even years, whereas SAS measurements\ntake days. However, with SAS it is not possible to measure the positions of the\natoms within the molecule.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Biological_small-angle_scattering","recorded":1376428515,"links":[],"instances":["mathematics","sans","physics","optics","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["X-rays","Scattering","Polymer physics"],"headings":["Definition","History","SAS data analysis","Biological molecule layers and GISAS","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["small_angle_neutron_scattering","sans"],["focus","optics"],["intensity","physics"],["regularization","mathematics"],["turn","biochemistry#loops"],["denaturation","biochemistry"],["small_angle_neutron_scattering","sans"]],"members":["turn","regularization","small_angle_neutron_scattering","intensity","focus","denaturation"],"related":["Small-angle_X-ray_scattering","Small_angle_neutron_scattering_(SANS)","X-ray_diffraction","Neutron_diffraction","Wide_angle_X-ray_scattering","Static_light_scattering","Nanometer","Surface","Volume","Macromolecule","Radiation_damage","X-ray","Neutron","Collimation","Focus_(optics)","Synchrotron_radiation","Concentration","Synchrotron","Intensity_(Physics)","Scattering_angle","NMR","X-ray_crystallography","Macromolecules","Wavelength","Neutrons","Monodisperse","Scattering_length_density","Electron_density","Deuterium","Deuteration","Protein_folding","Molecular_mass","Synchrotron_radiation","Macromolecular_assemblies","Electron_microscopy","Particle_aggregation","Indirect_Fourier_Transform","Radial_distribution_function","Regularization_(mathematics)","European_Molecular_Biology_Laboratory","Spherical_harmonics","Simulated_annealing","NMR","X-ray","Tertiary_structure","Crystallographic","Fold_recognition","De_novo_protein_structure_prediction","Fourier_transform","Homology_modeling","X-ray_crystallography","Electron_microscopy","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Lysozyme","Protein_kinase","GISAXS","Atomic_form_factor","Distorted_wave_Born_approximation","Refraction_index","Correlation_function","Small-angle_X-ray_scattering","Small_angle_neutron_scattering_(SANS)","Grazing-incidence_small-angle_X-ray_scattering","GISAXS","X-ray_crystallography","Electron_microscopy","NMR","Neutron_spin_echo","Protein_Data_Bank","Protein_dynamics","Protein_folding","Protein_threading","Homology_modeling","Rosetta@home","Bruker","Rigaku","PANalytical","Australian_Synchrotron","Advanced_Light_Source","ELETTRA","DESY","National_Synchrotron_Light_Source","Brookhaven_National_Laboratory","Cornell_Laboratory_for_Accelerator-based_Sciences_and_Education","Rigaku","PANalytical"]}
