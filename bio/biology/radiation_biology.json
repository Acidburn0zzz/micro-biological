At the same time, Pierre and Marie Curie discovered\nthe radioactive polonium and radium later used to treat cancer. In simplest\nterms, 'radiobiology' is the study of the action of ionizing radiation on\nliving things.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"radiation_biology","recorded":1376418400,"links":[],"instances":["esotericism","scientist","physicist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Radiobiology|*","Public health","Medical physics"],"headings":["Health effects","Exposure Pathways","History","Areas of interest","Radiation sources for radiobiology","See also","References and further reading"],"image":[],"tags":[["robley_d._evans","scientist"],["david_cohen","physicist"],["energy","esotericism"]],"members":["energy","david_cohen"],"related":["Medical_sciences","Leopold_Freund","Melanocytic_nevus","Electromagnetic_radiation","X-rays","Wilhelm_Röntgen","Marie_Curie","Cancer","Ionizing_radiation","Radiation_therapy","Thyrotoxicosis","Radiation-induced_cancer","Latent_period","Radiation_burns","Acute_radiation_syndrome","Medical_imaging","Radiotherapy","Radiation_hormesis","Stochastic","Radiation-induced_cancer","Teratogenesis","Radiation_induced_cognitive_decline","Heart_disease","Radiation_burn","Acute_radiation_syndrome","Chronic_radiation_syndrome","Radiation-induced_thyroiditis","Deterministic","Radiation-induced_lung_injury","Cataract","Atomic_bomb_survivors","Radioresistance","International_Commission_on_Radiological_Protection","International_Commission_on_Radiation_Units_and_Measurements","United_Nations_Scientific_Committee_on_the_Effects_of_Atomic_Radiation","National_Council_on_Radiation_Protection_and_Measurements","National_Radiological_Protection_Board","National_Academy_of_Sciences","Institut_de_radioprotection_et_de_sûreté_nucléaire","European_Committee_on_Radiation_Risk","Radioactive_source","Cosmic_ray","Cancer","Teletherapy","Brachytherapy","Committed_dose","Neutron","Neutron_activation","Potassium-40","Strontium-89","Cow","Milk","Radiopharmaceutical","Fission_product","Uranium_dioxide","Boron_neutron_capture_therapy","Boron-10","Nuclear_reactor","Neutron_moderator","Lithium-7","Helium-4","Alpha_particle","Cytotoxic","Committed_dose","Wilhelm_Röntgen","Free_radical","Hermann_Joseph_Muller","Nobel_prize","Patent_medicine","Radioactive_quackery","Enema","Marie_Curie","Aplastic_anemia","Eben_Byers","Radium","Radium_Girls","Robley_D._Evans_(scientist)","Nuclear_medicine","Nuclear_reactor","Nuclear_weapon","Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki","Midori_Naka","Radiation","Radiation_chemistry","Molecular_biology","Cell_biology","Molecular_genetics","Cell_death","Apoptosis","Electromagnetic_radiation_and_health","Specific_absorption_rate","Radiation_poisoning","Radiation_oncology","Radiation_therapy","Cancer","Bioelectromagnetics","Electric_field","Magnetic_field","Electrophysiology","Biomagnetism","David_Cohen_(physicist)","SQUID","Magnetobiology","Electromagnetic_radiation_and_health","Bioelectromagnetism","Bioelectromagnetics","Electrotherapy","Radiation_therapy","Radiogenomics","Electroconvulsive_therapy","Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation","Magnetic_resonance_imaging","Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging","Embryogenesis","Ontogeny","Developmental_biology","Bioenergetics","Biological_psychiatry","Neurology","Psychoneuroimmunology","Bioluminescence","Biophoton","Alexander_Gurwitsch","Energy_(esotericism)","Radioactive_isotope","Caesium-137","Cobalt-60","Particle_accelerator","Protons","Electrons","A-bomb","Microbeam","UV_lamp","Background_radiation","Cell_survival_curve","Health_threat_from_cosmic_rays","NASA_Space_Radiation_Laboratory","Nuclear_medicine","Radioactivity_in_biology","Radiology","Radiophobia","Radiosensitivity","Relative_biological_effectiveness"]}
