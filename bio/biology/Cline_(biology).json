{"cursor":"6200","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In biology and ecology, an 'ecocline' or simply 'cline' (from \"to possess or\nexhibit gradient, to lean\") describes an ecotone in which a series of\nbiocommunities display a continuous gradient. For definition and an\netymology, see [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cline Merriam-Webster\nentry for \"cline.\"] The term was coined by the English evolutionary\nbiologist Julian Huxley in 1938.\n\nMore technically, clines consist of ecotypes or forms of species that exhibit\ngradual phenotypic and/or genetic differences over a geographical area,\ntypically as a result of environmental heterogeneity. Genetically, clines result\nfrom the change of allele frequencies within the gene pool of the group of taxa\nin question.
