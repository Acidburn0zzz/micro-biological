Australia is\nthe first country to introduce a Biometrics Privacy Code, which is established\nand administered by the Biometrics Institute. The Biometrics Institute\n[http://www.biometricsinstitute.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr=8%20\nPrivacy Code] forms part of Australian privacy legislation.

[http://www.biometricsinstitute.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenb-\nr=8 Biometrics Institute Privacy Code]\n\nBrazil\n\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, Brazilian citizens have had user ID\ncards. The decision by the Brazilian government to adopt fingerprint-based\nbiometrics was spearheaded by Dr. Felix Pacheco at Rio de Janeiro, at that time\ncapital of the Federative Republic. Dr. Pacheco was a friend of Dr. Juan\nVucetich, who invented one of the most complete tenprint classification systems\nin existence. The Vucetich system was adopted not only in Brazil, but also by\nmost of the other South American countries. The oldest and most traditional ID\nInstitute in Brazil (Instituto de IdentificaÃ§Ã£o FÃ©lix Pacheco) was integrated at\nDETRAN (Brazilian equivalent to DMV) into the civil and criminal AFIS\nsystem in 1999.\n\nEach state in Brazil is allowed to print its own ID card, but the layout and\ndata are the same for all of them. The ID cards printed in Rio de Janeiro are\nfully digitized using a 2D bar code with information which can be matched\nagainst its owner off-line. The 2D bar code encodes a color photo, a signature,\ntwo fingerprints, and other citizen data. This technology was developed in 2000\nin order to enhance the safety of the Brazilian ID cards.\n\nBy the end of 2005, the Brazilian government started the development of its new\npassport. The new documents started to be released by the beginning of 2007, in\nBrasÃ­lia. The new passport included several security features, like Laser\nperforation, UV hidden symbols, security layer over variable data and etc.\nBrazilian citizens will have their signature, photo, and 10 rolled fingerprints\ncollected during passport requests. All of the data is planned to be stored in\nICAO E-passport standard. This allows for contactless electronic reading of the\npassport content and Citizens ID verification since fingerprint templates and\ntoken facial images will be available for automatic recognition.\n\nCanada Canada has begun research into the use of biometric technology in the\narea of border security and immigration ([http://www.css.drdc-rddc.gc.ca/index-\neng.asp Center for Security Sciences], [http://www.css.drdc-rddc.gc.ca/pstp/about-sujet/index-\neng.asp Public Security Technical Program], Biometrics Community of Practice).\nAt least one program, the NEXUS program operated jointly by the Canada Border\nServices Agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is already operational.\nIt is a functioning example of biometric technology, specifically \"iris\nrecognition biometric technology\" {{cite web\n| title = Cross Often? Make it simple, use NEXUS url = http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/prog/nexus/air-aerien-\n| eng.html#sup accessdate = June 12, 2011}} used for border control and\n| security for air travellers. Canada is also the home for the world's biggest\n| biometric access control company called Bioscrypt Inc..\n\nGambia The Gambia Biometric Identification System (GAMBIS) allowed for the\nissuance of Gambia's first biometric identity documents in July 2009. An\nindividual's data, including their biometric information (thumbprints) is\ncaptured in the database. A National Identification Number (NIN), unique to each\napplicant applying for a card, is issued to the applicant. Biometric documents\nissued for Gambia include national identity cards, residential permits, non-\nGambian ID cards and driver licenses.\n\nGermany The biometrics market in Germany will experience enormous growth until\nthe year 2009. \"The market size will increase from approximately 120 million â¬\n(2004) to 377 million â¬\" (2009). \"The federal government will be a major\ncontributor to this development\". In\nparticular, the biometric procedures of fingerprint and facial recognition can\nprofit from the government project. In May 2005 the\nGerman Upper House of Parliament approved the implementation of the ePass, a\npassport issued to all German citizens which contain biometric technology. The\nePass has been in circulation since November 2005, and contains a chip that\nholds a digital photograph and one fingerprint from each hand, usually of the\nindex fingers, though others may be used if these fingers are missing or have\nextremely distorted prints. \"A third biometric identifier â iris scans â could\nbe added at a later stage\". [http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/4338/194 IDABC â\nDE: Germany to phase-in biometric passports from November 2005] An\nincrease in the prevalence of biometric technology in Germany is an effort to\nnot only keep citizens safe within German borders but also to comply with the\ncurrent US deadline for visa-waiver countries to introduce biometric\npassports. In addition to producing biometric\npassports for German citizens, the German government has put in place new\nrequirements for visitors to apply for visas within the country. \"Only\napplicants for long-term visas, which allow more than three months' residence,\nwill be affected by the planned biometric registration program. The new work\nvisas will also include fingerprinting, iris scanning, and digital\nphotos\".\n\nGermany is also one of the first countries to implement biometric technology at\nthe Olympic Games to protect German athletes. \"The Olympic Games is always a\ndiplomatically tense affair and previous events have been rocked by terrorist\nattacksâmost notably when Germany last held the Games in Munich in 1972 and 11\nIsraeli athletes were killed\".\n\nBiometric technology was first used at the Olympic Summer Games in Athens,\nGreece in 2004. \"On registering with the scheme, accredited visitors will\nreceive an ID card containing their fingerprint biometrics data that will enable\nthem to access the 'German House'. Accredited visitors will include athletes,\ncoaching staff, team management and members of the media\".\n\nAs a protest against the increasing use of biometric data, the influential\nhacker group Chaos Computer Club published a fingerprint of German Minister of\nthe Interior Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble in the March 2008 edition of its magazine\nDatenschleuder. The magazine also included the fingerprint on a film that\nreaders could use to fool fingerprint readers.\n\nIndia\n\n\n\nIndia is currently implementing its Universal Identification (UID) program to\nprovide a unique identification number based on biometric identifiers to each of\nits 1.25 billion citizens. India's Home Minister, P Chidambaram, described the\nprocess as \"the biggest exercise... since humankind came into existence\". The\ngovernment will then use the information to issue identity cards the word which\nis popularly known as AADHAR CARD. Officials in India will spend one year\nclassifying India's population according to demographics indicators. The\nphysical count began on February 2011. The Universal ID (UID) program\nis administered by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).\n\nAlthough it is in early stages, the UID program is already the largest biometric\nidentification program in the world with more than 200 million people enrolled\nas of January 2012. Building a Biometric National ID: Lessons\nfor Developing Countries from India's Universal ID Program, Alan Gelb and Julia\nClark, The Center for Global Development, October 2012,\nhttp://www.cgdev.org/doc/full_text/GelbClarkUID/1426583.html\n\nUsing multiple biometrics\n\nUIDAI agents collect two iris scans, ten fingerprints, and a digital photograph\nfrom each enrollee. This multimodal system is advantageous because different\nbiometrics are better suited to different tasks. Iris scans provide more data\nthan fingerprints, essential for de-duplication, but fingerprints are easier and\ncheaper to authenticate. Having multiple measures also reduces the failure-to-\nenroll rate, as some people have worn fingerprints or damaged eyes.\n\nSupports public- and private-sector applications\n\nThe UID program is designed to be an \"identity service provider\" for both\ngovernment programs and the private sector. Users from public and private\nagencies can verify people's identity against their fingerprints and Aadhar\nnumber. When queried, the UID database returns a simple yes or no response to\nthe match; no personal information is provided, but users can prove their\nidentity.\n\nCompetitive, standards-based procurement\n\nThe UID program includes opportunities for vendors to compete and bring down\ncosts, also promoting innovation.\n\nCardless design has advantages, but may not work in all cases\n\nA variety of devices have been developed to verify identity at the point of\nservice. With cellular coverage, a biometric-enabled Bluetooth device can reach\nrural areas to authenticate ration payments, health insurance, and so on.\nCardless operation has advantages, particularly as cards are susceptible to\nhacking, forging, theft, and loss. However, cardless systems may not be possible\nin areas that lack internet access or complete mobile network coverage.\n\nUnclear jurisdiction\n\nIdentifying citizens in India falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of\nHome Affairs, not UIDAI. The Ministry is concurrently compiling the National\nPopulation Register, causing some confusion between the two agencies.\n\nOpen technology versus proprietary systems and foreign providers\n\nUID contracts out de-duplication to three private non-Indian service providers\nto take advantage of the latest technology. This may not be essential for a\nsmall country where requirements are less stringent, but it suggests the need to\ncarefully consider the roles of national and foreign providers and the relative\nadvantages of proprietary and open-source technology in designing a national\nbiometric system. \n\nIraq Biometrics are being used extensively in Iraq to catalogue as many Iraqis\nas possible providing Iraqis with a verifiable identification card, immune to\nforgery. During account creation, the collected biometrics information is logged\ninto a central database which then allows a user profile to be created. Even if\nan Iraqi has lost their ID card, their identification can be found and verified\nby using their unique biometric information. Additional information can also be\nadded to each account record, such as individual personal history.\n\nIsrael\n\nThe Israeli government has passed a bill calling for the creation of a biometric\ndatabase of all Israeli residents; the database will contain their fingerprints\nand facial contours. Upon enrolling, a resident would be issued a new form of an\nidentification card, containing these biometrics as well as being harder to\ncounterfeit and having a smart-card chip with a digital certificate, allowing\nfor digital signatures. In addition, smart-chip passports can be issued. The law\nis currently in its trial period, during which enrollment is optional; pending\non successful trial, enrollment would be mandatory for all residents upon\nissuance or replacement of Teudot Zehut .\n\nOpponents of the proposed law, including prominent Israeli scientists and\nsecurity experts, warned that the existence of such a database could damage both\ncivil liberties and state security, because any leaks could be used by criminals\nor hostile individuals against Israeli residents.\n\nItaly Italy has standardized protocols in use to police forces.

By using such a system nutritional reports can be produced for\nparents to surveil a child's intake. This has raised questions from liberty\ngroups as taking away the liberty of choice from the youth of society. Other\nconcerns arise from the possibility of data leaking from the providers of school\nmeals to interest groups that provide health services such as the NHS and\ninsurance groups that may end up having a detrimental effect on the ability of\nindividuals to enjoy equality of access to services.\n\nUnited States Starting in 2005, US passports with facial (image-based) biometric\ndata were scheduled to be produced. Privacy activists in many countries have\ncriticized the technology's use for the potential harm to civil liberties,\nprivacy, and the risk of identity theft. Currently, there is some apprehension\nin the United States (and the European Union) that the information can be\n\"skimmed\" and identify people's citizenship remotely for criminal intent, such\nas kidnapping.\n\nThe US Department of Defense (DoD) Common Access Card, is an ID card issued to\nall US Service personnel and contractors on US Military sites. This card\ncontains biometric data and digitized photographs. It also has laser-etched\nphotographs and holograms to add security and reduce the risk of falsification.\nThere have been over 10 million of these cards issued.\n\nAccording to Jim Wayman, director of the National Biometric Test Center at San\nJose State University, Walt Disney World is the nation's largest single\ncommercial application of biometrics. However, the US-VISIT program\nwill very soon surpass Walt Disney World for biometrics deployment.\n\nThe United States records all fingerprints and a picture of foreign airline\npassengers visiting the U.S., keeping it in databases for seventy-five years. It\nis suggested that such information should be shared among the U.S. and other\ncountries that have similar systems. Privacy advocates are worried about data\nleakage and misuse.\n\nNEXUS is a joint Canada-United States program operated by the Canada Border\nServices Agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. It is designed to\nexpedite travel cross the US-Canada border and makes use of biometric\nauthentication technology, specifically \"iris recognition biometric\ntechnology\".
