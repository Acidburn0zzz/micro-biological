Life evolves by means\nof mutations (changes in an organism's hereditary information), genetic drift\n(random change in the genetic variation of a population from generation to\ngeneration), and natural selection (the non-random and gradual process of\nnatural variation by which observable traits (such as eye color) become more or\nless common in a population).\n\nAll individuals have hereditary material in the form of genes that are\nreceived from their parents, then passed on to their offspring. Among\noffspring there are variations of genes due to the introduction of new genes\nvia random changes called mutations or via reshuffling of existing genes\nduring sexual reproduction. The offspring differs from the parent in minor random\nways. If those differences are helpful, the offspring is more likely to\nsurvive and reproduce. This means that more offspring in the next generation\nwill have that helpful difference and individuals will not have equal chances\nof reproductive success. In this way, traits that result in organisms being\nbetter adapted to their living conditions become more common in descendant\npopulations. These differences\naccumulate resulting in changes within the population. This process is\nresponsible for the many diverse life forms in the world.\n\nThe forces of evolution are most evident when populations become isolated,\neither through geographic distance or by other mechanisms that prevent genetic\nexchange. Over time, isolated populations can branch off into new species.\n\nThe majority of genetic mutations neither assist, change the appearance of, nor\nbring harm to individuals. Through the process of genetic drift, these mutated\ngenes are neutrally sorted among populations and survive across generations by\nchance alone. In contrast to genetic drift, natural selection is not a random\nprocess because it acts on traits that are necessary for survival. Natural selection and random genetic drift are constant\nand dynamic parts of life and over time this has shaped the branching structure\nin the tree of life.\n\nThe modern understanding of evolution began with the 1859 publication of Charles\nDarwin's [[On the Origin of Species]]. In addition, Gregor Mendel's work with\nplants helped to explain the hereditary patterns of genetics. Fossil discoveries in paleontology, advances in population\ngenetics and a global network of scientific research have provided further\ndetails into the mechanisms of evolution. Scientists now have a good\nunderstanding of the origin of new species (speciation) and have observed the\nspeciation process in the laboratory and in the wild. Evolution is the principal\ntheory that biologists use to understand life and is used in many disciplines,\nincluding medicine, psychology, conservation biology, anthropology, forensics,\nagriculture and other social-cultural applications.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"postzygotic_barrier","recorded":1376418405,"links":[],"instances":["dog","genus","biology","biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biological evolution|","Biology theories"],"headings":["Natural Selection","Source of variation","Genetic drift","Modern synthesis","Evidence for evolution","Co-evolution","Species","Mechanism","See also","References","Bibliography","Further reading","External links","Related information"],"image":[],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["hybrid","biology"],["python","genus"],["homology","biology"],["morphology","biology"],["chihuahua","dog"],["chihuahua","dog"],["morphology","biology"]],"members":["chihuahua","python","homology","hybrid","cell","morphology"],"related":["Evolutionary_biology","Mutation","Genetic_drift","Natural_selection","Gene","Gene","Reproduction","Adaptation","Speciation","Tree_of_life","Charles_Darwin","Gregor_Mendel","Genetics","Paleontology","Population_genetics","Speciation","Medicine","Psychology","Conservation_biology","Anthropology","Forensics","Agriculture","Sociocultural_evolution","Curators","Natural_history","HMS_Beagle","South_America","Galapagos_Islands","Orchidaceae","Insect","Pollination","Alfred_Russel_Wallace","Family_tree","Objections_to_evolution","Creation-evolution_controversy","Level_of_support_for_evolution","Scientific_community","Herbert_Spencer","Ostrich","Inheritance_of_acquired_characters","Transmutation_of_species","Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck","Lamarckism","Pangenesis","August_Weismann","Genetics","Gregor_Mendel","Gene","DNA","Molecule","Nucleotide","Mutation","Cell_(biology)","Chromosome","Sexual_reproduction","Hybrid_(biology)","Gene_flow","Orthogenesis","Evolution_of_complexity","Flea","Mecoptera","Python_(genus)","Extinction","Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event","Alleles","Hardy-Weinberg_principle","Immigration","Emigration","Population_bottleneck","Genetic_diversity","Northern_elephant_seal","Founder_effect","Amish","Pennsylvania","Ellis–van_Creveld_syndrome","R.A._Fisher","J.B.S._Haldane","Sewall_Wright","Mendelian_inheritance","Population_genetics","Theodosius_Dobzhansky","Ernst_W._Mayr","George_Gaylord_Simpson","Paleontology","Charles_Darwin","South_America","Armadillo","Richard_Owen","Glyptodon","Scientific_evidence","Biology","Fossil","Homology_(biology)","DNA","Paleontology","Georges_Cuvier","Sedimentary_rock","Catastrophism","James_Hutton","Charles_Lyell","Transitional_fossil","Morphology_(biology)","Alpha_taxonomy","Orangutan","Gorilla","Chimpanzee","Human","Shark","Dolphin","Fish","Mammal","Evolutionary_pressure","Embryo","Vertebrate","Tail","Pharyngeal_slit","Amphibian","Reptilian_humanoid","Pharyngula","Whale","Evolution_of_cetaceans","Intrinsic_muscles_of_external_ear","Wisdom_teeth","Vermiform_appendix","Coccyx","Androgenic_hair","Goose_bumps","Plica_semilunaris_of_the_conjunctiva","Eye","Biogeography","Island_biogeography","Alfred_Russel_Wallace","Ecological_niche","Adaptive_radiation","Darwin's_finches","Galapagos_Islands","Hawaiian_honeycreeper","Hawaiian_islands","Silversword_alliance","Madieae","Virus","Gene","Chimpanzee","Gorilla","Molecular_phylogeny","Chihuahua_(dog)","Mixed-breed_dog","Great_Dane","Chihuahua_(dog)","Great_Dane","Maize","Domestic_pigeon","Ant","Acacia","Herbivory","Altruism","Morphology_(biology)","Species","Ernst_W._Mayr","Bacteria","Asexual_reproduction","Theodosius_Dobzhansky","Nothing_in_Biology_Makes_Sense_Except_in_the_Light_of_Evolution","Gradualism","James_Hutton","Charles_Lyell","Catastrophism","Niles_Eldredge","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Punctuated_equilibrium","Unit_of_selection","Richard_Dawkins","Creation-evolution_controversy","Evidence_of_common_descent","Evolution_as_theory_and_fact","Level_of_support_for_evolution"]}
