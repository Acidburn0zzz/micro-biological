The\nisland is separated from peninsular downtown Charleston by the Ashley River,\nfrom the mainland by Wappoo Creek and the Wappoo Cut, and from Johns Island by\nthe Stono River. It lies inshore of Morris Island and Folly Beach.\n\nFort Sumter is located on an island just off the eastern tip of James Island and\nis the site of the first battle of the Civil War. Bombardment of Fort Sumter was\nstarted from Fort Johnson which is located on the eastern portion of James\nIsland. Several significant military engagements took place on island including\nthe battles of Secessionville (1862), Grimball's Landing (1863) and Grimball's\nCauseway (1865). All of these battles were alternately known as the \"Battle of\nJames Island\".\n\nFor much of the period before and after the formation of the United States,\nJames Island land was largely agricultural with close to 20 plantations making\nup much of the island. Growth accelerated after World War II and James Island\nbecame a suburban bedroom community to Charleston.\n\nAs of the 2000 census, the United States Census Bureau reported that 33,781\npeople lived on the island.

The town of James Island has been founded on\nthree separate occasions. Three incorporations were overturned as a result of\nlegal suits filed by the city. The third incorporation attempt was in contention\nin another legal suit by the city, and on November 7, 2008, the town's\nincorporation was upheld by a Circuit Court judge. The city of Charleston filed\nan appeal of the decision to the South Carolina Supreme Court.\nUltimately, this ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court.\n\nA fourth attempt at incorporation was successful, upheld by the courts and\nuncontested by the city of Charleston. There is now a legally formed Town of\nJames Island.\n\nAs defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of James Island is included\nwithin the Charleston-North Charleston Urbanized Area and the larger Charleston-\nNorth Charleston Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nSamuel Smalls, the man upon whom the novel [[Porgy]] and subsequent opera\n[[Porgy and Bess]] are based, is buried in the cemetery beside James Island\nPresbyterian Church.\n\nErnest Everett Just, the pioneering African American biologist and science\nwriter, grew up on James Island in the town of Maryville, named after his mother\nMary Matthews\nJust. http://www.westof.net/main.test.php?category=citizen&id=37\n\nComedian and political satirist Stephen Colbert, along with his 10 brothers and\nsisters, grew up on James Island.
