{"cursor":"4514","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In Web development jargon and information visualization, a 'hyperbolic tree'\n(often shortened as 'hypertree') defines a graph drawing method inspired by\nhyperbolic geometry.\n\n\n\nDisplaying hierarchical data as a tree suffers from visual clutter as the number\nof nodes per level can grow exponentially. For a simple binary tree, the maximum\nnumber of nodes at a level n is 2 n, while the number of nodes for\nlarger trees grows much more quickly. Drawing the tree as a node-link diagram\nthus requires exponential amounts of space to be displayed.\n\nOne approach is to use a hyperbolic tree, first introduced by Lamping et\nal. http://sigchi.org/chi95/Electronic/documnts/papers/jl_bdy.htm\nHyperbolic trees employ hyperbolic space, which intrinsically has \"more room\"\nthan Euclidean space. For instance, linearly increasing the radius of a circle\nin Euclidean space increases its circumference linearly, while the same circle\nin hyperbolic space would have its circumference increase exponentially.\nExploiting this property allows laying out the tree in hyperbolic space in an\nuncluttered manner: placing a node far enough from its parent gives the node\nalmost the same amount of space as its parent for laying out its own children.\n\nDisplaying a hyperbolic tree commonly utilizes the PoincarÃ© disk model of\nhyperbolic geometry, though the Klein-Beltrami model can also be used. Both\ndisplay the entire hyperbolic plane within a unit disk, making the entire tree\nvisible at once. The unit disk gives a fish-eye lens view of the plane, giving\nmore emphasis to nodes which are in focus and displaying nodes further out of\nfocus closer to the boundary of the disk. Traversing the hyperbolic tree\nrequires MÃ¶bius transformations of the space, bringing new nodes into focus and\nmoving higher levels of the hierarchy out of view.\n\nAlthough hyperbolic trees have been patented in the U.S. by Xerox, various Java\n& JavaScript implementations exist on the web as well as C++ & OpenGL. http-\n://vsxu.com http://vsxu.com/shots/030.jpg http://patft.uspt-\no.gov/netacgi/nph-\nParser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-\nbool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN%2F5590250\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Hyperbolic_tree","recorded":1376429034,"links":[],"instances":["data_structure","graphic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hyperbolic geometry","Graph drawing","Trees (data structures)"],"headings":["See also","External links","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["visualization","graphic"],["tree","data_structure"],["tree","graph_theory"],["tree","data_structure"]],"members":["tree","visualization"],"related":["Web_development","Jargon","Visualization_(graphic)","Graph_drawing","Hyperbolic_geometry","Tree_(data_structure)","Hyperbolic_geometry","Poincaré_disk_model","Klein_model","Möbius_transformation","Hyperbolic_geometry","Information_visualization","Tree_(graph_theory)","Tree_(data_structure)","Radial_tree","Tree_of_life","Association_for_Computing_Machinery"]}
