It was run on dirt over a distance of six\nfurlongs. Raced in the pre-grading era, for most of its existence the race was\none of the premier shorter distance competitions for two-year-old horses in the\nUnited States.\n\nThe first running of the United States Hotel Stakes took place in 1880 and was\nraced for three-year-olds until 1895 when it was changed to a competition for\ntwo-year-olds. The inaugural race was won by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame\ninductee, Luke Blackburn. It was so successful that in 1901 the [[The New York\nTimes|New York Times]] was reporting that it was a \"rich\" race because it\noffered a purse of $10,000. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A0-\n7E3DD1130E132A2575BC1A96E9C946097D6CF]\n\nWhile Man o' War, who would be ranked No.1 in the Blood-Horse magazine List of\nthe Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century, and other great horses in the\nhistory of American Thoroughbred racing won this race, it is also notable for\ntwo notable horses who did not. In 1929, the ensuing year's U.S. Triple Crown\nchampion and future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Gallant Fox finished\nsecond. Whirlaway, another U.S. Triple Crown champion and future U.S. Racing\nHall of Fame inductee, suffered the same fate in 1940.\n\nThe last horse to win the United States Hotel Stakes was Career Boy, a colt\nowned by prominent horseman Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney who went on to be voted\nthe American Champion Male Turf Horse for 1956. The runner-up was Canadian\nChamp, the 1956 Canadian Horse of the Year and Canadian Horse Racing Hall of\nFame inductee.\n","linknr":123,"url":"United_States_Hotel_Stakes","recorded":1376424199,"links":["/w/index.php?title=United_States_Hotel_Stakes&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Hotel_Stakes&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Hotel_Stakes","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course","/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Thoroughbred","/wiki/Flat_racing","/wiki/Furlong","/wiki/Thoroughbred_horse_race","/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course","/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York","/wiki/Furlong","/wiki/Graded_stakes_race","/wiki/National_Museum_of_Racing_and_Hall_of_Fame","/wiki/Luke_Blackburn_(horse)","/wiki/The_New_York_Times","http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E3DD1130E132A2575BC1A96E9C946097D6CF","/wiki/Man_o%27_War","/wiki/Blood-Horse_magazine_List_of_the_Top_100_U.S._Racehorses_of_the_20th_Century","/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing#United_States_Triple_Crowns","/wiki/Gallant_Fox","/wiki/Whirlaway","/wiki/Career_Boy","/wiki/Cornelius_Vanderbilt_Whitney","/wiki/American_Champion_Male_Turf_Horse","/wiki/Canadian_Champ","/wiki/Sovereign_Award_for_Horse_of_the_Year","/wiki/Canadian_Horse_Racing_Hall_of_Fame","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Hotel_Stakes&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Hotel_Stakes&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Career_Boy","/wiki/Summer_Tan","/wiki/Pavot","/w/index.php?title=El_Chico_(horse)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Ladysman","/wiki/Jamestown_(horse)","/wiki/Pompey_(horse)","/w/index.php?title=St._James_(horse)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Morvich","/wiki/Man_o%27_War","/w/index.php?title=Billy_Kelly_(horse)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Old_Rosebud_(horse)","/w/index.php?title=Burgomaster_(horse)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Kinley_Mack&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Hanover_(thoroughbred_horse)","/w/index.php?title=Drake_Carter&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Hindoo_(horse)","/wiki/Luke_Blackburn_(horse)","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Hotel_Stakes&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Hotel_Stakes&veaction=edit&section=2","http://www.pedigreequery.com/index.php?search_bar=stakes&query_type=stakes&field=view&id=1745","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_Hotel_Stakes&oldid=549171146","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Horse_races_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Flat_horse_races_for_two-year-olds","/wiki/Category:Recurring_events_established_in_1880","/wiki/Category:Discontinued_horse_races","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=United+States+Hotel+Stakes&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=United+States+Hotel+Stakes","/wiki/United_States_Hotel_Stakes","/wiki/Talk:United_States_Hotel_Stakes","#","/wiki/United_States_Hotel_Stakes","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Hotel_Stakes&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Hotel_Stakes&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Hotel_Stakes&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/United_States_Hotel_Stakes","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/United_States_Hotel_Stakes","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Hotel_Stakes&oldid=549171146","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Hotel_Stakes&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7889927","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=United_States_Hotel_Stakes&id=549171146","/w/index.php?title=Special:
