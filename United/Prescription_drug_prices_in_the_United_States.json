According to Barlett and Steele in Time Magazine in 2004,\n\"The prices Americans pay for prescription drugs, which are far higher than\nthose paid by citizens of any other developed country, help explain why the\npharmaceutical industry is â and has been for years â the most profitable of all\nbusinesses in the U.S. In the annual Fortune 500 survey, the pharmaceutical\nindustry topped the list of the most profitable industries, with a return of 17%\non revenue.\" National expenditures on pharmaceuticals accounted for\n12.9% of total health care costs, compared to an OECD average of 17.7% (2003\nfigures). The high price of prescription drugs is one of the major\nareas of discussion in the U.S. health care reform debate.\n\nAlthough the cost of manufacturing a drug is relatively low, the cost of\ndeveloping a new drug is relatively high, and the United States' high drug\nprices allow the U.S. pharmaceutical industry to invent a disproportionately\nhigh share of all drugs.

Smith and James T. O'Donnell, 2006, p.\n422, published by Informa Healthcare Herper states that \"A single clinical\ntrial can cost $100 million at the high end, and the combined cost of\nmanufacturing and clinical testing for some drugs has added up to $1\nbillion.\" Although the United States comprises only 5% of the world's\npopulation, it accounts for 36% of worldwide research and development of\npharmaceutical drugs. A study by Battelle\nMemorial Institute estimated that drug research will 'save' more than $750\nbillion in treatment costs for just five illnesses (AIDS, heart disease, cancer,\nAlzheimer's, and arthritis) over the next 25 years. Schizophrenia drugs which cost $4,500 per patient per year\nsave more than $70,000 per patient per year by rendering hospitalization unnecessary.

Nature Reviews Drug Discovery,\n2004 (3), 711-716. Critics of pharmaceutical companies point out that only\na small portion of the drug companies' expenditures are used for research and\ndevelopment, with the majority of their money being spent in the areas of\nmarketing and administration. [http://archive.psc-cuny.org/drugprices.htm\nWhy Are Drug Prices So High?], PSC/CUNY\n\nThe AARP has published a series of studies suggesting that prescription drug\nprices are rising significantly faster than general inflation. David Gross,\nLeigh Gross Purvis and Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, [http://www.aarp.org/research/health/drugs/aresearch-import-869-2004-06--\nIB69.html \"Trends in Manufacturer Prices of Prescription Drugs Used by Older\nAmericans\"], AARP, March 2007 The American Enterprise Institute, a\nconservative think tank, has criticized the methodology used as overstating drug\nprice inflation. Joseph Antos and Thomas F. Wildsmith,\n[http://www.aei.org/outlook/22818 \"Inflated Claims about Drug Prices\"], American\nEnterprise Institute, July 8, 2005\n\nThe statistics reflect that prices of brand name drugs in the United States are\nsignificantly higher than in Canada, India, the UK and other countries, nearly\nall of which have price controls. Prices for generic drugs tend to be higher in\nCanada. The price differential for brand-name drugs between the U.S. and Canada\nhas led Americans to purchase more than US$1 billion in drugs per year from\nCanadian pharmacies.\n\nTo save money, \"U.S. Customs estimates 10 million U.S. citizens bring in\nmedications at land borders each year. An additional 2 million packages of\npharmaceuticals arrive annually by international mail from Thailand, India,\nSouth Africa and other points,\" reports the Washington Post.

However, today, consumers shop at lower-cost online pharmacies in\nIndia, the UK, and other countries where they can save even more moneyâup to 60\nto 80 percent or more savings off US prices.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry has thousands of lobbyists in Washington, DC, that\nlobby Congress and protect their interests. The pharmaceutical industry spent\n$855 million, more than any other industry, on lobbying activities from 1998 to\n2006, according to the non-partisan Center for Public Integrity.
