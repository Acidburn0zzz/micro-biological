{"cursor":"25775","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n:Please see [[Regular Army (disambiguation)]] for countries other than the\nUnited States that use this term\n\nThe 'Regular Army' of the United States was and is the successor to the\nContinental Army as the country's permanent, professional military\nestablishment. Johnson, Mark W., That Body of Brave Men: The U.S. Regular\nInfantry and the Civil War in the West, p. ix. Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press,\n2003. Even in modern times the professional core of the United States Army\ncontinues to be called the Regular Army. From the time of the American\nRevolution until after the Spanish-American War, the small Regular Army of the\nUnited States was supported by State militias and volunteer regiments organized\nby States but thereafter controlled by federal authorities and generals in time\nof war. These volunteer regiments came to be called United States Volunteers\n(USV) in contrast to the Regular United States Army (USA). During the American\nCivil War, about 97 percent of the Union Army was United States Volunteers. In\ncontemporary use, the term Regular Army refers to the full-time active component\nof the United States Army, as distinguished from the Army Reserve and the Army\nNational Guard.\n\nThe American military system which developed from the combination of the\nprofessional, national Continental Army, the State militias and volunteer\nregiments of the American Revolutionary War, and the similar post-Revolutionary\nWar American military organization under the Militia Act of 1792, provided a\nbasis for the United States Army's organizations, with only minor changes, until\nthe creation of the modern National Guard in 1903. Wright, Jr., Robert K.\nand Morris J. MacGregor, Jr.\n[http://www.history.army.mil/books/revwar/ss/ch5.htm Soldier-Statesmen of the\nConstitution, Center of Military History, United States Army, Washington, D.C.,\n1987, First Printing-CMH Pub 71-25. Retrieved September 28, 2010.] The\nMilitia Act provided for the use of volunteers who could be used anywhere in\ntime of war in addition to the State militias who were restricted to local use\nwithin their States for short periods of time. Even today's professional United\nStates Army, which is augmented by the Army Reserve and Army National Guard has\na similar system of organization with a permanent, professional core and\nadditional units which can be called upon in time of war or emergency.\n","linknr":184,"url":"Regular_Army_(United_States)","recorded":1376428115,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Regular_Army_(United_States)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Regular_Army_(United_States)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_Army_(United_States)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_Army_(United_States)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Regular_Army_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Continental_Army","#cite_note-1","/wiki/United_States_Army","/wiki/American_Revolution","/wiki/Spanish-American_War","/wiki/Militia","/wiki/United_States_Volunteers","/wiki/American_Civil_War","/wiki/Union_Army","/wiki/United_States_Army_Reserve","/wiki/Army_National_Guard","/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War","#cite_note-2","#Continental_Army","#Legion_of_the_United_States","#War_of_1812","#Seminole_Wars","#Mexican-American_War","#Civil_War","#World_War_I","#Interwar_years","#World_War_II","#Post-war_years","#Notes","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Regular_Army_(United_States)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Regular_Army_(United_States)&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-Mahon6-4","#cite_note-Mahon7-5","#cite_note-Mahon7-5","#cite_note-Mahon11-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-Mahon12-10","/wiki/First_American_Regiment","/wiki/Josiah_Harmar","/wiki/War_of_1812","#cite_note-Mahon12-10","#cite_note-Mahon13-11","/w/index.php?title=Regular_Army_(United_States)&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Regular_Army_(United_States)&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/United_States_Army","/wiki/St._Clair%27s_Defeat","/wiki/General","/wiki/Arthur_St._Clair","/wiki/Fort_Recovery,_Ohio","#cite_note-Mahon13-11","/wiki/George_Washington","/wiki/Henry_Knox","/wiki/Secretary_of_War","/wiki/Legion_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Henry_Bouquet","/wiki/Colonel","/wiki/British_army","/wiki/Marshal_of_France","/wiki/Maurice_de_Saxe","/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War","/wiki/Major_General","/wiki/Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/First_American_Regiment","/wiki/2nd_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)","/wiki/Continental_Army","/wiki/3rd_US_Infantry_Regiment_(The_Old_Guard)","/wiki/2nd_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)","/wiki/4th_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)","/wiki/Fort_Lafayette_(Pennsylvania)","/wiki/Legionville","/wiki/Baden,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Pennsylvania","/wiki/Basic_training","/wiki/Northwest_Indian_War","/wiki/American_Indians_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Western_Confederacy","/wiki/Ohio_River","/wiki/Battle_of_Fallen_Timbers","/wiki/Brigadier_General","/wiki/James_Wilkinson","/wiki/Spy","/wiki/Monarchy_of_Spain","/wiki/1st_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)","/wiki/Epaulette","/wiki/3rd_United_States_Infantry_Regiment_(The_Old_Guard)","/wiki/4th_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)","/wiki/Origins_of_the_War_of_1812","#cite_note-Mahon13-11","/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Old_Northwest","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Chesapeake-Leopard_Affair","#cite_note-in_JSTOR-13","/w/index.php?title=Regular_Army_(United_States)&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Regular_Army_(United_States)&veaction=edit&section=3","#cite_note-14","#cite_note-Mahon14-15","/wiki/First_World_War","#cite_note-Mahon14-15","#cite_note-Mahon_and_Danysh.2C_1972.2C_p._24-16","#cite_note-17","/w/index.php?title=Regular_Army_(United_States)&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Regular_Army_(United_States)&veaction=edit&section=4","#cite_note-Mahon17-18","#cite_note-Mahon17-18","#cite_note-Mahon17-18","#cite_note-Mahon18-19","/w/index.php?title=Regular_Army_(United_States)&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Regular_Army_(United_States)&veaction=edit&section=5","/wiki/Mexican-American_War","#cite_note-Mahon18-19","#cite_note-20","#cite_note-Mahon18-19","#cite_note-Mahon_and_
