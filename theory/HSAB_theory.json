It\nassigns the terms 'hard' or 'soft', and 'acid' or 'base' to chemical species.\n'Hard' applies to species which are small, have high charge states (the charge\ncriterion applies mainly to acids, to a lesser extent to bases), and are weakly\npolarizable. 'Soft' applies to species which are big, have low charge states and\nare strongly polarizable. The concept is a way of applying the notion\nof orbital overlap to specific chemical cases.\n\nThe theory is used in contexts where a qualitative, rather than quantitative,\ndescription would help in understanding the predominant factors which drive\nchemical properties and reactions. This is especially so in transition metal\nchemistry, where numerous experiments have been done to determine the\nrelative ordering of ligands and transition metal ions in terms of their\nhardness and softness.\n\nHSAB theory is also useful in predicting the products of metathesis reactions.\nQuite recently it has been shown that even the sensitivity and performance of\nexplosive materials can be explained on basis of HSAB theory.
