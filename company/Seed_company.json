The\nproduction of seed is a multi billion dollar business, which uses growing\nfacilities and growing locations world wide. While most seed is produced by\nlarge specialist growers, large amounts are produced by small growers that\nproduce only one to a few crop types. These larger companies supply seed both to\ncommercial resellers and wholesalers. The resellers and wholesalers sell to\nvegetable and fruit growers, and to companies who package seed into packets and\nsell them on to the amateur gardener.\n\nMost seed companies or resellers that sell retail, produce a catalog â\ngenerally published during early winter for seed to be sown the following\nspring. These catalogs are eagerly awaited by the amateur gardener, as during\nwinter months there is little that can be done in the garden, so this time can\nbe spent planning the following yearâs gardening. The largest collection of\nnursery and seed trade catalogs in the U.S. is held at the National\nAgricultural Library. The earliest catalogs there date from the late 18th\ncentury, with most published from the 1890s to the present.

Gilbert Nursery and Seed Trade Catalog Collection.\"]\nNational Agricultural Library, Special Collections. Retrieved April 23,\n2009. Shakers were among the earliest commercial producers of garden\nseeds; the first seeds sold in paper packets were produced by the Watervliet\nShakers.

Many gardeners like to stick to old familiar\nvarieties but each year seed companies produce new varieties for gardeners to\ntry. They have extensive research facilities to produce plants with better\ngenetic materials that result in improved uniformity and gardening appeal. These\nimproved qualities might include disease resistance, higher yields, dwarf habit\nand vibrant or new colors. These improvements are often closely guarded to\nprotect them from being utilized by other producers, thus plant cultivars are\noften sold under their own names and by international laws protected from being\ngrown for seed production by others. Along with the growth in the allotment\nmovement, and the increasing popularity of gardening, there have emerged many\nsmall independent seed companies. Many of these are active in seed conservation\nand encouraging diversity. They often offer organic and open pollinated\nvarieties of seeds as opposed to hybrids. Many of these varieties are heirloom\nvarieties. The use of old varieties will continue to maintain diversity in the\nhorticultural gene pool. There is a good case for amateur gardeners to use older\n(heirloom) varieties as the modern seed types are often the same as those grown\nby commercial producers, and so characteristics which are useful to them (e.g.\nvegetables ripening at the same time) may be unsuited to home growing.\n","linknr":156,"url":"Seed_company","recorded":1376428765,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Seed_company&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Seed_company&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_company","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seed_company&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:VM_4680_Wuchang_seed_shops.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/VM_4680_Wuchang_seed_shops.jpg/220px-VM_4680_Wuchang_seed_shops.jpg","/wiki/File:VM_4680_Wuchang_seed_shops.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Wuhan","/wiki/Wuchang_Railway_Station","/wiki/Seed","/wiki/Flower","/wiki/Fruit","/wiki/Vegetable","/wiki/Gardener","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/National_Agricultural_Library","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Shakers","/wiki/Watervliet_Shaker_Historic_District","#cite_note-Deming-2","#cite_note-Miller-3","/wiki/F1_hybrid","/wiki/Allotment_(gardening)","/wiki/Conservation_movement","/wiki/List_of_organic_gardening_and_farming_topics","/wiki/Pollination","/wiki/Horticulture","/wiki/Gene_pool","#Seed_packets_and_seed_information","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Seed_company&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Seed_company&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:South_Central_Farm_1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/South_Central_Farm_1.jpg/220px-South_Central_Farm_1.jpg","/wiki/File:South_Central_Farm_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Botanical","/wiki/Soil","/wiki/Height","/wiki/Height","/wiki/Soil","/wiki/Water","/wiki/Moisture","/wiki/Drench","/wiki/Misting","/wiki/Sun","/wiki/Shade_(shadow)","/wiki/Indoor","/wiki/Outdoor","/wiki/Perennial_plant","/wiki/Annual_plant","/wiki/Planting","/wiki/Germination","/wiki/Harvest","/wiki/4_(number)","/w/index.php?title=Seed_company&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Seed_company&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/Seedbank","/wiki/Arboretum","/wiki/Biodiversity","/wiki/Monoculture","/wiki/ESA_European_Seed_Association","/w/index.php?title=Seed_company&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Seed_company&veaction=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.nal.usda.gov/speccoll/collectionsguide/nurserycatalogs.shtml","/wiki/National_Agricultural_Library","#cite_ref-Deming_2-0","#cite_ref-Miller_3-0","/w/index.php?title=Seed_company&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Seed_company&veaction=edit&section=4","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Seed_shops","http://www.dmoz.org/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Plants/Seeds/","/wiki/Open_Directory_Project","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seed_company&oldid=562653941","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Seed_companies","/wiki/Category:Plant_reproduction","/wiki/Category:Types_of_business_entity","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_February_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Seed+company&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Seed+company","/wiki/Seed_company","/wiki/Talk:Seed_company","#","/wiki/Seed_company","/w/index.php?title=Seed_company&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Seed_company&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Seed_company&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/
