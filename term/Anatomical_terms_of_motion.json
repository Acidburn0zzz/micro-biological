All such movements are\nclassified by the directions in which the affected structures are moved. In\nhuman anatomy, all descriptions of position and movement are based on the\nassumption that the body is in its complete medial and abduction stage and is in\nanatomical position.\n\nThe prefix 'hyper-' is sometimes added to describe movement beyond the normal\nlimits to a limb's or organ's motion, such as in 'hyperflexion' or\n'hyperextension'. Such movements are variously important; they may be used in\nsurgery, such as in temporarily dislocating joints for surgical procedures, and\nalso may be important in that they may seriously stress the joints involved.\nSee: Medical terminology\n\nAll motions are considered to be a mixture of or a single contribution by the\nfollowing types of movement.\n\nMost terms of a motion have clear opposites, and as such, are treated\nbelow in pairs.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Anatomical_terms_of_motion","recorded":1376418353,"links":[],"instances":["geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anatomical terms of motion|*"],"headings":["General motion","Special motions of the hands and feet","Other special motions","See also","References","External references","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["cone","geometry"]],"members":["cone"],"related":["Muscle","Human_anatomy","Anatomical_position","Joint","Medical_terminology","Extension","Elbow-joint","Anterior","Rectus_femoris","Sartorius_muscle","Iliacus","Psoas_major_muscle","Biceps_femoris","Semitendinosus","Semimembranosus","Brachialis","Biceps_brachii","Brachioradialis","Handshake","Triceps_brachii","Anconeus","Gluteus_maximus","Quadriceps","Rectus_femoris","Vastus_lateralis","Vastus_medialis","Vastus_intermedius","Deltoid_muscle","Gluteus_medius","Gluteus_minimus","Adductor_brevis","Adductor_longus","Adductor_magnus","Pectineus","Latissimus_dorsi","Pectoralis_major","Subscapularis","Adductor_longus","Adductor_brevis","Sartorius_muscle","Infraspinatus","Teres_minor","Trapezius","Orthopaedics","Pronator_quadratus","Pronator_teres_muscle","Supinator_muscle","Ankle","GERD","Cone_(geometry)","Ball-and-socket_joint","Human_eye","Arm","Hand","Wrist","Anatomical_terms_of_location","Medical_terminology"]}
