Trilobites form one\nof the earliest known groups of arthropods. The first appearance of trilobites\nin the fossil record defines the base of the Atdabanian stage of the Early\nCambrian period (), and they flourished throughout the lower Paleozoic era\nbefore beginning a drawn-out decline to extinction when, during the Devonian,\nall trilobite orders except Proetida died out. Trilobites finally disappeared in\nthe mass extinction at the end of the Permian about . The trilobites were among\nthe most successful of all early animals, roaming the oceans for over 270\nmillion years. http://firstlifeseries.com/learn-more/\n\nWhen trilobites first appeared in the fossil record they were already highly\ndiverse and geographically dispersed. Because trilobites had wide diversity and\nan easily fossilized exoskeleton an extensive fossil record was left behind,\nwith some 17,000 known species spanning Paleozoic time. The study of these\nfossils has facilitated important contributions to biostratigraphy,\npaleontology, evolutionary biology and plate tectonics. Trilobites are often\nplaced within the arthropod subphylum Schizoramia within the superclass\nArachnomorpha (equivalent to the Arachnata), although\nseveral alternative taxonomies are found in the literature.\n\nTrilobites had many life styles; some moved over the sea-bed as predators,\nscavengers or filter feeders and some swam, feeding on plankton. Most life\nstyles expected of modern marine arthropods are seen in trilobites, with the\npossible exception of parasitism (where there are still scientific debates). Some trilobites (particularly the family Olenidae) are even\nthought to have evolved a symbiotic relationship with sulfur-eating bacteria\nfrom which they derived food.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Trilobite#Terminology","recorded":1376428690,"links":[],"instances":["county","biology","eye","biology","anatomy","biology","lens","biology","biology","trilobite_anatomy","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Trilobites|","Fossils","Prehistoric
