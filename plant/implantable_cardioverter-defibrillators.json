The device is programmed to detect cardiac arrhythmia and correct\nit by delivering a jolt of electricity. In current variants, the ability to\nrevert ventricular fibrillation has been extended to include both atrial and\nventricular arrhythmias. There also exists the ability to perform biventricular\npacing in patients with congestive heart failure or bradycardia.\n\nThe process of implantation of an ICD is similar to implantation of a pacemaker.\nSimilar to pacemakers, these devices typically include electrode wire(s) that\npass through a vein to the right chambers of the heart, usually lodging in the\napex of the right ventricle. The difference is that pacemakers are more often\ntemporary and are generally designed to correct bradycardia, while ICDs are\noften permanent safeguards against sudden arrhythmias.\n\nThe most recent development is the subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD). Current state-of-the-\nart electronics and batteries have enabled an implantable device to deliver\nenough energy to defibrillate the heart without the need for a lead in or on\nthe heart. This prevents lead-related problems and the risk of dangerous\ninfections in or near the heart. This ICD is positioned just under the skin and\noutside the ribcage. It can be placed during a minor procedure under conscious\nsedation. The S-ICD was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nin September 2012.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"implantable_cardioverter-defibrillators","recorded":1376428634,"links":[],"instances":["electricity","mood","heart","heart"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cardiac electrophysiology","Implants","Neuroprosthetics"],"headings":["Working mechanism","History","Living with an ICD","Clinical trials","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["battery","electricity"],["atrium","heart"],["ventricle","heart"],["ventricle","heart"],["atrium","heart"],["depression","mood"]],"members":["battery","depression","ventricle","atrium"],"related":["Guidant_Corporation","Battery_(electricity)","Sudden_cardiac_death","Ventricular_fibrillation","Ventricular_tachycardia","Cardiac_arrhythmia","Electricity","Atrium_(heart)","Ventricle_(heart)","Congestive_heart_failure","Bradycardia","Artificial_pacemaker","Electrode","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Ventricular_tachycardia","Heart","Ventricle_(heart)","Atrium_(heart)","Torsades","Cardiac_rhythm","Sinai_Hospital","Baltimore","Michel_Mirowski","Morton_Mower","University_of_Missouri","Sinus_rhythm","Bernard_Lown","Defibrillator","Anti-arrhythmic","Johns_Hopkins_Hospital","Thoracotomy","Psychological","Cardiac_psychology","Antiarrhythmic_agent","Anxiety","Side_effect","Depression_(mood)","Contraindication","Magnetic_resonance_imaging","Congestive_heart_failure","Multicenter_Automatic_Defibrillator_Implantation_Trial","Epicardium","Pericardium","Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation","Advanced_cardiac_life_support","Cardioversion","Defibrillation","Artificial_pacemaker","Boston_Scientific","Cameron_Health","Medtronic","St_Jude_Medical","Sorin_Group","Biotronik","Wearable_cardioverter_defibrillator","Samuel_Sears"]}
