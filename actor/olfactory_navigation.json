{"cursor":"14382","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"s may navigate by smell]]\n\n'[[Olfactory]] navigation' is a hypothesis put forward to explain navigation and\nhoming of pigeons, in particular the homing pigeon.\n\nThere are two principal versions. Papiâs mosaic model proposes that pigeons\nconstruct a map from the distribution of environmental odours, within a radius\nof 70-100 kilometres. Wallraffâs gradient theory overcomes the problem of\ndistance limitation by proposing the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric\nodour gradients. However, the evidence to suggest that pigeons use an âolfactory\nmapâ in order to home is not conclusive.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"olfactory_navigation","recorded":1376427864,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Columba (genus)","Pigeon racing","Navigation","Olfaction","Animal migration"],"headings":["Background","Olfactory map","Empirical evidence","Other sensory cues","Inconclusive evidence","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["homing","biology"],["homing","biology#magnetic_orientation"]],"members":["homing"],"related":["Pigeons","Homing_pigeon","Homing_(biology)","Compass","Map","Anosmic","Odours","Dovecote","Aviary","William_Tinsley_Keeton","Anosmic","Benzaldehyde","William_Tinsley_Keeton","Magnetic_coil","Magnetic_anomaly","European_Starling"]}
