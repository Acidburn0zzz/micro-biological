{"cursor":"13396","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" in the [[Ranunculus auricomus]] complex help to swell the number of species in\n the genus [[Ranunculus]].|alt=A buttercup flower, with three yellow petals out\n of five.]] There are 57 genera of flowering plants estimated to contain at\n least 500 described species. The largest of these is currently the legume genus\n [[Astragalus]] (milk-vetches), with over 3,000 species.\n\nThe sizes of plant genera vary widely from those containing a single species to\ngenera containing thousands of species, and this disparity became clear early in\nthe history of plant classification. The largest genus in Carl Linnaeus' seminal\n[[Species Plantarum]] was [[Euphorbia]], with 56 species; Linnaeus believed that\nno genus should contain more than 100 species.\n\nPart of the disparity in genus sizes is attributable to historical factors.\nAccording to a hypothesis published by Max Walters in 1961, the size of plant\ngenera is related to the age, not of the taxon itself, but of the concept of the\ntaxon in the minds of taxonomists. Plants which grew\nin Europe, where most of the early taxonomy was based, were therefore divided\ninto relatively small genera, while those from the tropics were grouped into\nmuch larger and more heterogeneous genera. Likewise, plants which shared common medicinal\nproperties, such as the many species of [[Euphorbia]], were united into a single\ngenus, while plants of diverse uses, such as the grasses, were split into many\ngenera. Where there were many classical names for groups of\nplants, such as in Apiaceae / Umbelliferae or Brassicaceae / Cruciferae, small\ngenera were defined, whereas groups not subdivided by classical authors remained\nas larger genera, such as [[Carex]].\nA number of biological factors also influence the number of species. For\ninstance, the occurrence of apomixis allows the recognition of large numbers of\nagamospecies, and such taxa have helped to bolster genera such as [[Ranunculus]]\nand [[Potentilla]].\n\nThe introduction of infrageneric taxa (such as the subgenus, section and series)\nin the 19th century by botanists including Augustin Pyrame de Candolle allowed\nthe retention of large genera that would otherwise have become unwieldy. E. J.\nH. Corner believed that studying large genera might enable greater insights into\nevolutionary biology, and he concentrated his efforts on large tropical genera\nsuch as [[Ficus]].\n","linknr":-1,"url":"List_of_the_largest_genera_of_flowering_plants","recorded":1376418374,"links":[],"instances":["botany","botany"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Angiosperm genera| List of Largest Flowering Plant Genera","Lists of plants|Largest Genera Of Flowering Plants","Lists of superlatives"],"headings":["Largest genera","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["section","botany"],["series","botany"]],"members":["section","series"],"related":["Species_complex","Genus","Flowering_plant","Species_description","Fabaceae","Monotypic_genus","Carl_Linnaeus","Max_Walters","Taxon","Taxonomist","Tropics","Poaceae","Apiaceae","Brassicaceae","Apomixis","Agamospecies","Subgenus","Section_(botany)","Series_(botany)","Augustin_Pyrame_de_Candolle","E._J._H._Corner","Evolutionary_biology","Monograph","Astragalus_agnicidus","Bulbophyllum_guttulatum","Psychotria_mariniana","Euphorbia_amygdaloides","Carex_pilulifera","Fabaceae","Orchidaceae","List_of_Bulbophyllum_species","Rubiaceae","Euphorbiaceae","List_of_Euphorbia_species","Cyperaceae","List_of_Carex_species","Begoniaceae","Orchidaceae","List_of_Dendrobium_species","Fabaceae","List_of_Acacia_species","Solanaceae","List_of_Solanum_species","Asteraceae","List_of_Senecio_species","Euphorbiaceae","List_of_Croton_species","Orchidaceae","List_of_Pleurothallis_species","Myrtaceae","Piperaceae","Myrsinaceae","Myrtaceae","Ericaceae","List_of_Rhododendron_species","Melastomataceae","Piperaceae","List_of_Peperomia_species","Lamiaceae","List_of_Salvia_species","Ericaceae","Balsaminaceae","Cyperaceae","Phyllanthaceae","List_of_Phyllanthus_species","Amaryllidaceae","List_of_Allium_species","Orchidaceae","List_of_Epidendrum_species","Asteraceae","Orchidaceae","List_of_Lepanthes_species","Araceae","List_of_Anthurium_species","Ebenaceae","Moraceae","Caryophyllaceae","Fabaceae","Oxalidaceae","Fabaceae","Asteraceae","Fabaceae","Myrtaceae","List_of_Eucalyptus_species","Orchidaceae","Rubiaceae","Asteraceae","Convolvulaceae","Dioscoreaceae","Gesneriaceae","Asteraceae","Ranunculaceae","List_of_Ranunculus_species","Orchidaceae","Acanthaceae","Araliaceae","List_of_Schefflera_species","Rubiaceae","Berberidaceae","Fagaceae","List_of_Quercus_species","Pandanaceae","Poaceae","Orchidaceae","Polygalaceae","Rosaceae","List_of_Potentilla_species"]}
