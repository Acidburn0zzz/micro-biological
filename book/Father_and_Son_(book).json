{"cursor":"4312","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Father and Son' (1907) is a memoir by poet and critic Edmund Gosse, which he\nsubtitled \"a study of two temperaments.\" Edmund had previously published a\nbiography of his father,  originally published anonymously. The book\ndescribes Edmund's early years in an exceptionally devout Plymouth Brethren\nhome. His mother, who died early and painfully of breast cancer, was a writer of\nChristian tracts. His father, Philip Henry Gosse, was an influential, though\nlargely self-taught, invertebrate zoologist and student of marine biology who,\nafter his wife's death, took Edmund to live in Devon. The book focuses on the\nrelationship between a sternly religious father who rejects the new evolutionary\ntheories of his scientific colleague Charles Darwin and the son's gradual coming\nof age and rejection of his father's fundamentalist religion.\n\nAs Michael Newton, Lecturer in English, University College London, has written,\nthe book is \"a brilliant, and often comic, record of the small diplomacies of\nhome: those indirections, omissions, insincerities, and secrecies that underlie\nfamily relationships.\" \"[B]rilliantly written, and full of gentle wit,\" the book\nis \"an unmatched social document, preserving for us whole the experience of\nchildhood in a Protestant sect in the Victorian period....Above all, it is one\nof our best accounts of adolescence, particularly for those who endured...a\nreligious upbringing.\" Edmund Gosse, Father and Son, ed. Michael Newton\n(New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), x-xi.\n\nAlthough Edmund Gosse prefaces the book with the claim that the incidents\ndescribed are sober reality, \"At the present hour, when fiction takes forms\nso ingenious and so specious, it is perhaps necessary to say that the following\nnarrative, in all its parts, and so far as the punctilious attention of the\nwriter has been able to keep it so, is scrupulously true. \"Preface\" a\nmodern biography of Philip Henry Gosse by Ann Thwaite Ann Thwaite, Glimpses\nof the Wonderful: The Life of Philip Henry Gosse, 1810-1888 (London: Faber and\nFaber, 2002). presents him not as a repressive tyrant who cruelly\nscrutinized the state of his son's soul but as a gentle and thoughtful person of\n\"delicacy and inner warmth,\" much unlike his son's portrait. Biographer and\ncritic, D. J. Taylor described the latter as \"horribly partial\" and noted that\n\"the supposedly sequestered, melancholic pattern of [Edmund] Gosse's London and\nDevonshire childhood is repeatedly proved to have contained great affection,\nfriends, fun and even light reading.\"\n[http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,799588,00.html Review of\nThwaite] by D.
