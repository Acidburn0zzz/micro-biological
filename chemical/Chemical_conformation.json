{"cursor":"2771","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'chemical structure' includes molecular geometry, electronic structure and\ncrystal structure of molecules. Molecular geometry refers to the spatial\narrangement of atoms in a molecule and the chemical bonds that hold the atoms\ntogether. Molecular geometry can range from the very simple, such as diatomic\noxygen or nitrogen molecules, to the very complex, such as protein or DNA\nmolecules. Molecular geometry can be roughly represented using a structural\nformula. Electronic structure describes the occupation of a molecule's\nmolecular orbitals.\n\nThe theory of chemical structure was first developed by Aleksandr Butlerov,\nwhich stated that the chemical compounds are not a random cluster of atoms and\nfunctional groups but structures with definite order formed according the\nvalency of the composing atoms. Other important contributors were Archibald\nScott Couper and Friedrich August Kekule.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Chemical_conformation","recorded":1376427632,"links":[],"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemistry","Analytical chemistry"],"headings":["Structure determination","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["valency","chemistry"]],"members":["valency"],"related":["Molecular_geometry","Electronic_structure","Crystal_structure","Molecule","Atom","Molecule","Chemical_bond","Diatomic","Oxygen","Nitrogen","Protein","DNA","Structural_formula","Molecular_orbital","Aleksandr_Butlerov","Valency_(chemistry)","Atoms","Archibald_Scott_Couper","Friedrich_August_Kekule","Chemistry","KiB","Spectroscopy","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","Infrared_spectroscopy","Raman_spectroscopy","Electron_microscopy","X-ray_crystallography","X-ray_diffraction","Optical_resolution","Crystal","Structural_elucidation","X-ray_diffraction","Proton_NMR","Carbon-13_NMR","Mass_spectrometry","Infrared_spectroscopy","Electron-spin_resonance","Cyclic_voltammetry","Electron_absorption_spectroscopy","X-ray_photoelectron_spectroscopy","Pauli_exclusion_principle","Lipinski's_Rule_of_Five","QSAR","Chemical_property","Molecular_property","Physical_property","Crystallographic_database"]}
