He was also a\nleading authority on Gilbert White and made over 1,000 radio and television\nbroadcasts on natural history subjects.\n\nFisher was the son of Kenneth Fisher, (also a keen ornithologist and headmaster\nof Oundle School from 1922 to 1945); his maternal uncle was the Cheshire\nnaturalist Arnold Boyd. He was educated at Eton, and began studying medicine at\nMagdalen College, Oxford, but later switched to zoology. He took part in the\nOxford Arctic expedition in 1933 as ornithologist. After university he joined\nLondon Zoo as an assistant curator, and during the war studied rooks for the\nMinistry of Agriculture. He later became a leading member of the RSPB and IUCN,\na member of the National Parks Commission and vice-chairman of the Countryside\nCommission.\n\nJames Fisher was one of the members of the small party that on 18 September 1955\nraised the Union Flag and took official possession for the UK of the tiny,\nuninhabited, rocky islet of Rockall, in the North Atlantic. {{cite book\n|title=Rockall |last=Fisher |first=James |authorlink=W:James Fisher |year=1957\n|publisher=Country Book Club |location=London |origyear=1956 }}\n\nAs well as writing his own books, he was an editor of Collins' New Naturalist\nseries. He was the resident ornithologist in the regular \"Nature\nParliament\" series broadcast in the 1950s on BBC radio as part of Children's\nHour. It is likely that his writing and broadcasting played a significant role\nin the growth of interest in birdwatching in the United Kingdom in the post-\nSecond World War period.\n\nHe was awarded the British Trust for Ornithology's Bernard Tucker Medal in\n1966.\n\nHe was married to Margery Lilian Edith Turner, and they had 6 children. He died\nin a car crash in September 1970.\n\nAfter Fisher's death he was commemorated in two ways. A public appeal allowed\nthe seabird island of Copinsay, Orkney, to be purchased as a permanent nature\nreserve dedicated to his name.
