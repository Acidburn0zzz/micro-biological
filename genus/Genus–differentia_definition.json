Thus, the definiendum in such definitions is always a species (and\nnot an individual), while the definiens consists of two parts:\n# 'a [[genus]]' (or family): A pre-defined term that includes the species\n# defined as a subtype. 'the [[differentia]]': The condition that distinguishes\n# the species from other instances of the same genus.\nFor example, consider these two definitions:\n* a [[triangle]]: A plane figure that has 3 straight bounding sides.\n* a [[quadrilateral]]: A plane figure that has 4 straight bounding sides.\n  Those definitions can be expressed as one genus and two differentiae:\n# one genus: A plane figure. two differentiae:\n#* the differentia for a triangle: that has 3 straight bounding sides.\n#* the differentia for a quadrilateral: that has 4 straight bounding sides.\nNote that the genus-species relation is relative. One may define \"dog\" as a\nspecies of the genus \"animal\", while \"puppy\" is a species of the genus \"dog\".\nThus, whether \"dog\" is a species or a genus depends on context.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Genusâdifferentia_definition","recorded":1376418361,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Definition","Dichotomies","Philosophy of language","Abstraction","Difference"],"headings":["Differentiation and Abstraction","Examples","Criteria for genus-differentia definitions","References"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Intensional_definition"]}
