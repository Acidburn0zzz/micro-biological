It is also known in English dialects as 'throstle' or 'mavis'. It has\nbrown upperparts and black-spotted cream or buff underparts and has three\nrecognised subspecies. Its distinctive song, which has repeated musical phrases,\nhas frequently been referred to in poetry.\n\nThe Song Thrush breeds in forests, gardens and parks, and is partially migratory\nwith many birds wintering in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East;\nit has also been introduced into New Zealand and Australia. Although it is not\nthreatened globally, there have been serious population declines in parts of\nEurope, possibly due to changes in farming practices.\n\nThe Song Thrush builds a neat mud-lined cup nest in a bush or tree and lays four\nor five dark-spotted blue eggs. It is omnivorous and has the habit of using a\nfavourite stone as an \"anvil\" on which to break open the shells of snails. Like\nother perching birds (passerines), it is affected by external and internal\nparasites and is vulnerable to predation by cats and birds of prey.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"song_thrush","recorded":1376427575,"links":[],"instances":["animal","habitat","biology","feather","biology","poet","biology","princess_of_athens","bird","disambiguation","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Turdus","Birds of Australia","Birds of Europe","Birds of Turkey","Birds of New Zealand","Birds of Pakistan","Birds of Palestine","Animals described in 1831"],"headings":["Taxonomy and systematics","Description","Distribution and habitat","Behaviour and ecology","Status and conservation","Relationship with humans","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["thrush","bird"],["thrush","bird"],["philomela","princess_of_athens"],["hybrid","biology"],["covert","feather"],["heath","habitat"],["territory","animal"],["dark-throated_thrush","disambiguation"],["vagrancy","biology"],["egg","biology"],["polymorphism","biology"],["edward_thomas","poet"]],"members":["territory","heath","polymorphism","covert","hybrid","edward_thomas","vagrancy","philomela","thrush","egg"],"related":["Netherlands","Animal","Chordate","Aves","Passerine","Thrush_(bird)","Christian_Ludwig_Brehm","Thrush_(bird)","Eurasia","English_language","Dialect","Subspecies","Bird_song","Forest","Bird_migration","Europe","North_Africa","Middle_East","New_Zealand","Australia","Bird_egg","Omnivorous","Anvil","Land_snail","Passerine","Parasite","Predation","Cat","Bird_of_prey","Germany","Ornithology","Christian_Ludwig_Brehm","Scientific_name","Latin","Greek_mythology","Philomela_(princess_of_Athens)","Ancient_Greek","German_language","French_language","Geoffrey_Chaucer","Middle_English","Old_French","Middle_Breton","Purple","Greek_language","Mistle_Thrush","Chinese_Thrush","Common_Blackbird","Subspecies","United_Kingdom","Ornithologist","William_Eagle_Clarke","Sedentism","Outer_Hebrides","Isle_of_Skye","Scotland","Zoology","Ernst_Hartert","William_Eagle_Clarke","Great_Britain","Ireland","Europe","France","Belgium","Netherlands","Iberian_peninsula","Hybrid_(biology)","Inner_Hebrides","Scotland","Siberia","Russia","Sergei_Aleksandrovich_Buturlin","Gram","Ounce","Sweden","Covert_(feather)","Redwing","Supercilium","Mistle_Thrush","Chinese_Thrush","White-faced_Whistling_Duck","Iberian_Peninsula","Italy","Greece","Ukraine","Russia","Lake_Baikal","Scandinavia","Eastern_Europe","Mediterranean","Middle_East","Acclimatisation_society","Kermadec_Islands","Chatham_Islands","Auckland_Islands","Melbourne","Switzerland","Heath_(habitat)","England","Territory_(animal)","Fieldfare","Dark-throated_Thrush_(disambiguation)","Monogamy","Vagrancy_(biology)","Greenland","Egg_(biology)","Brood_parasite","Cuckoo","Common_Cuckoo","Mimicry","Common_Blackbird","Cat","Little_Owl","Eurasian_Sparrowhawk","European_Magpie","Eurasian_Jay","Eastern_gray_squirrel","Nematode","Encephalitis","Bacteria","Lyme_disease","Grove_snail","Omnivorous","Invertebrate","Earthworm","Snail","Berry","Land_snail","Slug","Insect","Larva","Grove_Snail","Polymorphism_(biology)","Palaearctic","IUCN_Red_List","Least_Concern","Regional_Red_List","Road_kill","Robert_Browning","Thomas_Hardy","Ted_Hughes","Edward_Thomas_(poet)","Romanticism","William_Wordsworth","West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C.","Public_house","Birdlime","European_Union","Valencian_Community","European_Union","Aviculture","BirdLife_International","British_Trust_for_Ornithology","Chambers_Dictionary","The_American_Heritage_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language","Lonely_Planet","International_Journal_of_Medical_Microbiology","British_Trust_for_Ornithology","Joint_Nature_Conservation_Committee","Commission_of_the_European_Communities","Las_Provincias","Europa_Press"]}
