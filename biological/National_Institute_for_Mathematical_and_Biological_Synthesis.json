{"cursor":"6827","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis' is a research\ninstitute focused on the science of mathematics and biology. Known by its\nacronym NIMBioS (pronounced NIM-bus), the Institute opened in September 2008,\narising from a collaborative agreement between the National Science Foundation,\nthe U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture, with additional support from The University of Tennessee (UT), Kno-\nxville. http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=112167&org=NSF&from=n-\news.html http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080903/full/455011a.html NIMBioS hosts more than 600 scientists each year at its facility located on\nthe UT campus.\n\nPrimary goals of NIMBios are: *to address key biological questions using cross-\ndisciplinary approaches in mathematical biology *to foster the development of a\ncadre of researchers who are capable of conceiving and engaging in creative and\ncollaborative connections across disciplines.\n\nTo achieve its goals, NIMBioS advances a wide variety of research and\noutreach/education activities designed to facilitate interaction between\nmathematicians and biologists to arrive at innovative solutions to environmental\nproblems. Two primary mechanisms for research are Working Groups and\nInvestigative Workshops. Working Groups are composed of 10-15 invited\nparticipants focusing on specific questions related to mathematical biology.\nEach group typically meets at the Institute two to three times over the course\nof two years. Investigative workshops may include 30-40 participants with some\ninvited by organizers and others accepted through an open application process.\nWorkshops are more general in focus and may lead to working group formation.\nNIMBioS also provides support for post-doctoral and sabbatical fellows, short-\nterm visitors, graduate research assistants, and faculty collaborators at UT.\n\nResearch activities have investigated intragenomic conflict, multi-scale\nsimulation of cellular processes, human origins, natural system dynamics, and\ninfectious diseases in systems with wildlife\nhosts. http://quest.utk.edu/2009/nimbios/\n\nNIMBioS encourages multidisciplinary participation in all its activities.\nParticipants at NIMBioS have included behavioral biologists, ecologists,\nevolutionary biologists, computational scientists, anthropologists, geneticists,\npsychologists, bioinformaticians, mathematicians, statisticians, veterinarians,\nepidemiologists, and wildlife biologists.\n\nNIMBioS has an active Education and Outreach program with events and activities\nfor everyone from elementary school students through college professors and the\ngeneral public. At the college level, NIMBioS organizes a Research Experience\nfor Undergraduates program for eight weeks each summer. Undergraduates majoring\nin math, biology, and related fields live on campus and work in collaborative\nteams with UT professors on a variety of biological research projects using\nmathematical methods. NIMBioS also hosts the annual Undergraduate Research\nConference at the Interface of Biology and Mathematics each fall, featuring\nstudent talks and poasters as well as panel discussions. Programs for graduate\nstudents include the Visiting Graduate Student Fellowship offering training and\nresearch visits for up to several months by graduate students interested in\npursuing research with NIMBioS senior personnel, postdoctoral fellows or working\ngroup participants.\n\nFor teachers, NIMBioS offers the Teacher Collaboration Program in which teachers\nwith interest in mathematics and biology are paired with active researchers in\nthe math biology community. Collaboration activities range from teaching\nprojects and classroom visits to curriculum design and after school activities.\n\nNIMBioS provides varying levels of tutorial workshops designed to enlighten\nbiologists about key quantitative methods, such as optimal control and\noptimization or high performance computing methods for analyzing biological\nproblems involving large data sets, spatial information, and dynamics.\n\nNIMBioSâ director is Louis Gross, Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology\nand Mathematics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. NIMBioS leadership\nteam also includes associate directors and a deputy director. NIMBioS has an\nexternal Board of Advisors from academic institutions from around the world. In\naddition, NIMBioS has a group of senior personnel consisting of UT faculty and\nOak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) scientists, as well as a group of\nadditional associated faculty and staff collaborators from UT and ORNL.\n\nNIMBioS collaborates with the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to develop\nmethods of particular interest for natural area management that are transferable\nto numerous U.S. locations. Other partners in NIMBioS include IBM and ESRI.\n\nThe need for the Institute arose out of the significant growth of the field of\nmathematical biology over the last decade with research becoming more closely\nlinked to observation and experiment. Rather than starting from mathematical\nabstractions, it is now common for researchers to 1) begin with observations; 2)\nuse those to suggest promising methods, tools and models; and 3) proceed to\nanalysis, simulation, evaluation and application. Across the spectrum of the\nlife sciences in which mathematics has been contributing new insights, data are\nincreasingly used to focus conceptual models as the first step in problem\nformulation.\n\nThe NIMBioS website includes descriptions of working groups, investigative\nworkshops, post-doctoral fellowships, sabbaticals, short-term visits, graduate\nassistantships, and faculty positions and information on how to submit requests\nfor support. The web site also describes education and outreach opportunities\nfor undergraduates, teachers, and K-12 students. The web site also has an\nextensive video library including interviews with visiting scientists, full-\nlength seminars, and short narrative science features.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2012, NIMBioS, in conjunction with the UT's James R. Cox Endowment\nFund, sponsored a Songwriter-in-Residence Program to encourage the creation and\nproduction of songs involving ideas of modern biology and the lives of\nscientists who pursue research in biology. A total of five songwriters were\nsupported. Each songwriter created and produced a minimum of two songs as a\nresult of his or her four-week residency.\n","linknr":103,"url":"National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis","recorded":1376426616,"links":["/w/index.php?title=National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Science","/wiki/Mathematics","/wiki/Biology","/wiki/National_Science_Foundation","/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Homeland_Security","/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Agriculture","/wiki/The_University_of_Tennessee","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Intragenomic_conflict","/wiki/System_dynamics","/wiki/Infectious_diseases","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory","/wiki/Great_Smoky_Mountains_National_Park","/wiki/IBM","/w/index.php?title=National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=112167&org=NSF&from=news.html","#cite_ref-2","http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080903/full/455011a.html","#cite_ref-3","http://quest.utk.edu/2009/nimbios/","/w/index.php?title=National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis&veaction=edit&section=2","http://www.nimbios.org","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis&oldid=546730698","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Bioinformatics","/wiki/Category:Epidemiology","/wiki/Category:Biostatistics","/wiki/Category:Mathematical_and_theoretical_biology","/wiki/Category:Biotechnology","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=National+Institute+for+Mathematical+and+Biological+Synthesis&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=National+Institute+for+Mathematical+and+Biological+Synthesis","/wiki/National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis","/wiki/Talk:National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis","#","/wiki/National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis","/w/index.php?title=National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis&oldid=546730698","/w/index.php?title=National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6973585","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis&id=546730698","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=National+Institute+for+Mathematical+and+Biological+Synthesis","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=National+Institute+for+Mathematical+and+Biological+Synthesis&oldid=54673069
