Manufacturers and other vendors submit samples from their batches\nof dyes to the BSC's independent laboratory in Rochester NY. The BSC's\ncertification label on a bottle of dye indicates that the contents are from a\nbatch that passed the tests for chemical purity and for efficacy as a biological\nstain. These tests are published (Penney et al. 2002a). Changes to tests and\nadditions to the list of stains eligible for certification are published from\ntime to time in 'Biotechnic & Histochemistry' and are summarized on the\nCommission's web site. http://biologicalstaincommission.org/WhatNew.html.\nRetrieved 2013-07-23.\n\nThe BSC is a non-profit organization, incorporated in the State of New York, for\nthe purpose of ensuring a supply of high quality stains (mostly dyes) for use in\nbiological and medical laboratories. Its origins date from 1922, when vendors of\nbiological stains in the USA had exhausted their stocks of pre-war dyes imported\nfrom Germany. American dye manufacturers were unable to produce products that\nwere consistently reliable in histological microtechnique and bacteriology (Conn\n1980â1981; Penney 2000).\n\nThe Commission's testing laboratory was initially at the Agriculture\nExperimental Station in Geneva, NY, directed by Dr Harold Joel\nConn. http://www.twu.edu/dsc/connI.htm | Deaf Scientists Corner\nSince 1947 the laboratory has been located at the University of Rochester\nMedical College, Rochester, NY. Currently 57 individual dyes and about 5\nmixtures of different dyes are certified by the BSC. The assays and other\ntests used in the Commission's laboratory are all published, making the\nrequired standards known to both vendors and users of biological stains\n(Penney et al.\n2002a,b). http://biologicalstaincommission.org/NewsDyes.html. Retrieved\n2013-07-23.\n\nSince 1925 the BSC has published a scientific journal, named 'Stain Technology'\nuntil 1991, when the name was changed to 'Biotechnic &\nHistochemistry'. [http://informahealthcare.com/journal/bih Biotechnic &\nHistochemistry], Informa Healthcare\n\nThe annual meetings of the BSC are held at the end of the first week in June, in\ncities easily accessible by air from major centers in North America and Europe.\nThese meetings include scientific sessions with presentations by invited\nspeakers in such disciplines as cancer biology, neuroscience, pathology and\nplant sciences. There are also informal presentations and exchanges of\ninformation among academic biologists, medical scientists, pathologists, and\nrepresentatives of companies that manufacture and sell biological\nstains.
