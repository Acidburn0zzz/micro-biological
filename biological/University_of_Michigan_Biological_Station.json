{"cursor":"2906","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'The University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS)' is a research and\nteaching facility operated by the University of Michigan. It is located on the\nsouth shore of Douglas Lake in Cheboygan County, Michigan. The station consists\nof 10,000 acres (40 kmÂ²) of land near Pellston, Michigan in the northern\nLower Peninsula of Michigan and 3,200 acres (13 kmÂ²) on Sugar Island in the\nSt. Maryâs River near Sault Ste. Marie, in the Upper Peninsula. It is one of\nonly 47 Biosphere Reserves in the United States.\n\nFounded in 1909, it has grown to include approximately 150 buildings, including\nclassrooms, dormitories, a dining hall, and research facilities. Undergraduate\nand graduate courses are available in the spring and summer terms. It has a full-\ntime staff of 15.\n\nIn the 2000s, UMBS is increasingly focusing on the measurement of climate\nchange. Its field researchers are gauging the impact of global warming and\nincreased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide on the ecosystem of the upper\nGreat Lakes region, and are using field data to improve the computer models used\nto forecast further change. Several archaeological digs have been conducted at\nthe station as well.\n\nUMBS field researchers sometimes call the station \"bug camp\" amongst themselves.\nThis is believed to be due to the number of mosquitoes and other insects\npresent. It is also known as \"The Bio-Station\".\n\nThe UMBS is also home to Michigan's most endangered species and one of the most\nendangered species in the world: the Hungerford's Crawling Water Beetle. The\nspecies lives in only five locations in the world, two of which are in Emmet\nCounty. One of these, a two and a half mile stretch downstream from the Douglas\nRoad crossing of the East Branch of the Maple River supports the only stable\npopulation of the Hungerford's Crawling Water Beetle, with roughly 1000\nspecimens. This area, though technically not part of the UMBS is largely within\nand along the boundary of the University of Michigan Biological Station.\n\nUMBS also works heavily with the dropping piping plover population in\nNorthern Michigan.\n","linknr":117,"url":"University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station","recorded":1376424377,"links":["/w/index.php?title=University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/University_of_Michigan","/wiki/Douglas_Lake_(Michigan)","/wiki/Cheboygan_County,_Michigan","/wiki/Pellston,_Michigan","/wiki/Lower_Peninsula_of_Michigan","/wiki/Sugar_Island_(Michigan)","/wiki/St._Marys_River_(Michigan-Ontario)","/wiki/Sault_Ste._Marie,_Michigan","/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan","/wiki/Biosphere_Reserve","/wiki/Climate_change","/wiki/Global_warming","/wiki/Carbon_dioxide","/wiki/Ecosystem","/wiki/Computer_model","/wiki/Mosquito","/wiki/Hungerford%27s_Crawling_Water_Beetle","/w/index.php?title=University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station&veaction=edit&section=1","http://www.lsa.umich.edu/umbs/","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station&params=45.55969_N_-84.67423_E_type:landmark_region:US-MI","/wiki/File:Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg/30px-Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg","/wiki/Biology","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Biology-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Biology-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Biology-stub&action=edit","/wiki/File:Map_of_USA_highlighting_Midwest.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Map_of_USA_highlighting_Midwest.png/30px-Map_of_USA_highlighting_Midwest.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station&action=edit","/wiki/Template:US-midwest-university-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:US-midwest-university-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:US-midwest-university-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station&oldid=563583503","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:University_of_Michigan_campus","/wiki/Category:Biosphere_reserves_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Protected_areas_of_Michigan","/wiki/Category:Biological_stations","/wiki/Category:Protected_areas_of_Emmet_County,_Michigan","/wiki/Category:Education_in_Emmet_County,_Michigan","/wiki/Category:Protected_areas_of_Chippewa_County,_Michigan","/wiki/Category:1909_establishments_in_Michigan","/wiki/Category:Biology_stubs","/wiki/Category:Midwestern_United_States_university_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=University+of+Michigan+Biological+Station&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=University+of+Michigan+Biological+Station","/wiki/University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station","/wiki/Talk:University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station","#","/wiki/University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station","/w/index.php?title=University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/University_of_Michigan_Biological_Station","/wiki/Spe
