{"cursor":"2770","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Registry of Standard Biological Parts' is a collection of genetic parts\nthat are used in the assembly of systems and devices in synthetic biology. The\nregistry was founded in 2003 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The\nregistry contains over 3400 parts. Recipients of the genetic parts include\nacademic labs, established scientists, and student teams participating in the\niGEM Foundation's annual synthetic biology competition. Bland, Eric.

BioBrick was developed by a\nnonprofit composed of researchers from MIT, Harvard, and UCSF. The registry\noffers genetic parts with the expectation that recipients will contribute data\nand new parts to improve the resource. The registry records and indexes\nbiological parts and offers services including the synthesis and assembly of\nbiological parts, systems, and devices.\n\nThe registry offers many types of biological parts, including DNA, plasmids,\nplasmid backbones, primers, promoters, protein coding sequences, protein\ndomains, ribosomal binding sites, terminators, translational units,\nriboregulators, and composite parts.

It also includes devices such as protein\ngenerators, reporters, inverters, receptors, senders, and measurement devices. A\nkey idea that motivated the development of the Registry was to develop an\nabstraction hierarchy implemented through the parts categorization\nsystem.
