The Commission has been certifying electronic health record\ntechnology since 2006 and is approved by the Office of the National Coordinator\nfor Health Information Technology (ONC) of the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services (HHS) as an Authorized Testing and Certification Body (ONC-ATCB).\nThe 'CCHIT Certified' program is an independently developed certification that\nincludes a rigorous inspection of an EHRâs integrated functionality,\ninteroperability and security using criteria developed by CCHITâs broadly\nrepresentative, expert work groups. These products may also be certified in the\nONC-ATCB certification
