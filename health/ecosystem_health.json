In 'medicine', ecological health\nhas been used to refer to multiple chemical sensitivity, which results from\nexposure to synthetic chemicals (pesticides, smoke, etc.) in the environment,\nhence the term 'ecological'. Gibson, Pamela Reed (2000). Multiple chemical\nsensitivity: a survival guide. New Harbinger Publications Incorporated, 375\nPages. The term has also been used in 'medicine' with respect to\nmanagement of environmental factors (taxes, health insurance surcharges) that\nmay reduce the risk of unhealthy behavior such as smoking. Sorensen, Gloria\net al. (2013). âIntention to quit smoking and concerns about household\nenvironmental risks: findings from the Health in Common Study in low-income\nhousing.â Cancer Causes & Control, 24:805-811.  As an '[[urban planning]]'\nterm, ecological health refers to the âgreennessâ of cities, meaning composting,\nrecycling, and energy efficiency. Teodorescu, Gabriela (2010). âClimate\nchange impact on urban ecosystems and sustainable development of cities in\nRomania.â CWSEAS Transactions on environment and development, 6:103-112.\nWith respect to 'broader environmental issues', ecological health has been\ndefined as âthe goal for the condition at a 'site' that is cultivated for crops,\nmanaged for tree harvest, stocked for fish, urbanized, or otherwise intensively\nused.â  KARR, J. R., (1996). âEcological integrity and\necological health are not the same.â Pp. 97-109, In: Schulz, P. (ed.)\nEngineering Within Ecological Constraints Washington, D.C.: National Academy\nPress.  Ecological health differs from 'ecosystem health', the condition\nof ecosystems, which have particular structural and functional\nproperties, Belaoussoff, Svenja and Peter G. Kevan (2003). âAre There\nEcological Foundations for Ecosystem Health?â The Environmentalist,\n23:255â263. and it differs from 'ecological integrity', which refers to\nenvironments with minimal human impact,  although the term\necological health has also been used 'loosely' in reference to a range of\nenvironmental issues.\n\nThe term 'health' is intended to evoke human environmental health concerns,\nwhich are often closely related (but as a part of medicine not ecology). As with\necocide, that term assumes that ecosystems can be said to be alive (see also\n[[Gaia philosophy]] on this issue). While the term 'integrity' or 'damage' seems\nto take no position on this, it does assume that there is a definition of\nintegrity that can be said to apply to ecosystems. The more political term\necological wisdom refers not only to recognition of a level of health, integrity\nor potential damage, but also, to a decision to do nothing (more) to harm that\necosystem or its dependents. An ecosystem has a good health if it is capable of\nself-restoration after suffering external disturbances. This is termed\nresilience.\n\nMeasures of broad ecological health, like measures of the more specific\nprinciple of biodiversity, tend to be specific to an ecoregion or even to an\necosystem. Measures that depend on biodiversity are valid indicators of\necological health as stability and productivity (good indicators of ecological\nhealth) are two ecological effects of biodiversity. Dependencies between species\nvary so much as to be difficult to express abstractly. However, there are a few\nuniversal symptoms of poor health or damage to system integrity:\n\n* The buildup of waste material and the proliferation of simpler life forms\n  (bacteria, insects) that thrive on it - but no consequent population growth in\n  those species that normally prey on them;\n* The loss of keystone species, often a top predator, causing smaller carnivores\n  to proliferate, very often overstressing herbivore populations;\n* A higher rate of species mortality due to disease rather than predation,\n  climate, or food scarcity;\n* The migration of whole species into or out of a region, contrary to\n  established or historical patterns;\n* The proliferation of a bioinvader or even a monoculture where previously a\n  more biodiverse species range existed.\n\nSome practices such as organic farming, sustainable forestry, natural\nlandscaping, wild gardening or precision agriculture, sometimes combined into\nsustainable agriculture, are thought to improve or at least not to degrade\necological health, while still keeping land usable for human purposes. This is\ndifficult to investigate as part of ecology, but is increasingly part of\ndiscourse on agricultural economics and conservation.\n\nEcotage is another tactic thought to be effective by some in protecting the\nhealth of ecosystems, but this is hotly disputed. In general, low confrontation\nand much attention to political virtues is thought to be important to\nmaintaining ecological health, as it is far faster and simpler to destroy an\necosystem than protect it - thus wars on behalf of ecosystem integrity may\nsimply lead to more rapid despoliation and loss due to competition.\n\nDeforestation and the habitat destruction of deep-sea coral reef are two issues\nthat prompt deep investigation of what makes for ecological health, and fuels a\ngreat many debates. The role of clearcuts, plantations, and trawler nets is\noften portrayed as negative in the extreme, held akin to the role of weapons on\nhuman life.
