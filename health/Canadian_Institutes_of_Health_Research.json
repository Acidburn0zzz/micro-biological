{"cursor":"4534","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Canadian Institutes of Health Research' ('CIHR') is the major federal agency\nresponsible for funding health research in Canada. It is the successor to the\n'Medical Research Council of Canada'. It aims to create new health knowledge,\nand to translate that knowledge from the research setting into real world\napplications. The CIHR was created by an Act of Parliament on June 7, 2000;\nbringing together existing government activities. In 2009-2010, CIHR's budget\nwas just over 1 billion dollars.\n\nCIHR is a Departmental Corporation listed in Schedule II of the Financial\nAdministration Act. As an arms length agency of government, it is accountable to\nParliament through the Minister of Health.\n\nCIHR is managed by the Prime Minister and the Governing Council, who are\nassisted by various Standing and Advisory Committees. The current appointed\npresident of CIHR is Dr. Alain Beaudet.\n\nCIHR consists of 13 \"virtual\" institutes, each headed by a Scientific Director\nand assisted by an Institute Advisory Board. They work together to shape a\nnational health research agenda for Canada. The institutes bring together\nresearchers, health professionals and policy-makers from voluntary health\norganizations, provincial government agencies, international research\norganizations and industry and patient groups from across the country with a\nshared interest in improving the health of Canadians.\n\nThe work of the institutes embraces the four pillars of health research:\nbiomedical; clinical; research respecting health systems and services; and the\nsocial, cultural and environmental factors that affect the health of\npopulations. A major challenge for the institutes is to forge relationships\nacross disciplines to stimulate integrative, multifaceted research agendas that\nrespond to society's health priorities while adhering to the highest ethical\nstandards.\n\nCIHR supports more than 14,000 researchers and researchers in training as part\nof the federal government's investment in health research. The peer review\nprocess is a vital part of CIHR. Review by panels of peers from the research\ncommunity ensures proposals approved for funding by CIHR meet international\naccepted standards of scientific excellence.\n\nIn 2008 CIHR also organised a series of CafÃ© Scientifique events across Canada.[http://www.cihr-\nirsc.gc.ca/e/34951.html]\n\nCIHR is supplying funding for PubMed Central Canada in partnership with the\nUnited States National Library of Medicine (NLM) and Canada Institute for\nScientific and Technical Information (NRC-CISTI).\n\nIn November 2009, controversy arose over the appointment of a senior executive\nof Pfizer to CIHR's governing council.[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/11/27/pfizer-\nappointment.html]\n","linknr":116,"url":"Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research","recorded":1376423476,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:CIHRlogo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d1/CIHRlogo.jpg","/wiki/File:CIHRlogo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Health","/wiki/Peer_review","/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Scientifique","http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/34951.html","/wiki/PubMed_Central_Canada","/wiki/United_States_National_Library_of_Medicine","/wiki/Canada_Institute_for_Scientific_and_Technical_Information","/wiki/Pfizer","http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/11/27/pfizer-appointment.html","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research&veaction=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/National_Research_Council_of_Canada","/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health","/wiki/Medical_Research_Council_(UK)","/wiki/Canadian_government_scientific_research_organizations","/wiki/Canadian_university_scientific_research_organizations","/wiki/Canadian_industrial_research_and_development_organizations","/wiki/EvidenceNetwork.ca","/wiki/Canadian_Foundation_for_Healthcare_Improvement","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research&veaction=edit&section=3","http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/","http://www.cihr.gc.ca/e/29650.html","http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/34951.html","http://www.facebook.com/pages/Health-Research-in-Canada/130650012033","/wiki/Template:Canadian_funding_agencies","/wiki/Template_talk:Canadian_funding_agencies","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Canadian_funding_agencies&action=edit","/wiki/Funding_of_science","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Natural_Sciences_and_Engineering_Research_Council","/wiki/Social_Sciences_and_Humanities_Research_Council","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research&oldid=548182181","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Medical_research_institutes","/wiki/Category:Health_Canada","/wiki/Category:Medical_and_health_organizations_based_in_Canada","/wiki/Category:Research_institutes_in_Canada","/wiki/Category:Canadian_federal_departments_and_agencies","/wiki/Category:Funding_bodies_of_Canada","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Canadian+Institutes+of+Health+Research&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Canadian+Institutes+of+Health+Research","/wiki/Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research","/wiki/Talk:Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research","#","/wiki/Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Canadian_
