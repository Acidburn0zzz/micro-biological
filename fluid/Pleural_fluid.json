The 'pleura' is a serous membrane\nwhich folds back onto itself to form a two-layered membrane structure. The thin\nspace between the two pleural layers is known as the pleural cavity and normally\ncontains a small amount of pleural fluid. The outer pleura (parietal pleura) is\nattached to the chest wall. The inner pleura (visceral pleura) covers the lungs\nand adjoining structures, via blood vessels, bronchi and nerves.\n\nThe parietal pleura is highly sensitive to pain, while the visceral pleura is\nnot, due to its lack of sensory innervation.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Pleural_fluid","recorded":1376427894,"links":[],"instances":["physiology","physiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pleura"],"headings":["Functions","Structure","Development","Pleural fluid","Diseases","See also","Additional images","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["respiration","physiology"],["ventilation","physiology"]],"members":["respiration","ventilation"],"related":["Thorax","Lungs","Thorax","Mediastinum","Pericardial_cavity","Pericardium","Heart","Intraembryonic_coelom","Human_anatomy","Serous_membrane","Parietal_pleura","Thoracic_wall","Visceral_pleura","Blood_vessel","Bronchus","Nerve","Sensory_innervation","Respiration_(physiology)","Ventilation_(physiology)","Surface_tension","Alveoli","Pneumothorax","Tension_pneumothorax","Serous_fluid","Intercostal_arteries","Bulk_flow","Lymphatic_system","Pleural_effusion","Pulmonary_embolism","Cytopathology","Medical_diagnosis","Immunohistochemistry","Idiopathic","Dyspnea","Thoracoscopy","Pneumothorax","Pleural_effusion","Pleural_tumors","Pleural_plaques","Bronchioles","Bronchus","Capillaries","Epiglottis","Larynx","Mesothelioma","Pharynx","Pleural_disease","Pleurisy","Pleurodesis","Pleuropulmonary_blastoma","Rings_of_cartilage","Solitary_fibrous_tumor","Tension_pneumothorax","Thoracic_cavity","Vertebrate_trachea","Pleural_effusion"]}
