{"cursor":"6301","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and\nBehavioral Research' was the first public national body to shape bioethics\npolicy in the United States.\n\nFormed in the aftermath of the Tuskegee Experiment scandal, the Commission was\ncreated in 1974 as Title II of the National Research Act. It was part of the\nUnited States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW) until\n1978. The President's Council on Bioethics. \"Former Bioethics Commissions.\"\nThe Bioethics Research Library at Georgetown University. The President's Council\non Bioethics, 1998. Web. 19 Mar. 2012.\n\n\nThe Commission had four goals that it needed to analyze: 1. the boundaries\nbetween biomedical and behavioral research and what the accepted and routine\npractices of medicine were, 2. assessing the risks and benefits of the\nappropriateness of research involving human subjects, 3. determining appropriate\nguidelines for how human subjects can be chosen for the participation in such\nresearch and 4. defining what informed consent is in each research\nsetting. http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.html\n\nThe Commission also had the task of making recommendations to the Secretary of\nHealth, Education, and Welfare and Congress for the protection of Human\nsubjects. The commission produced their Reports and Recommendations on the\nfollowing areas of research:\n\n*Research on the Fetus (1975) [http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/reports/pas-\nt_commissions/research_fetus.pdf] *Research Involving Prisoners (1976) [http://-\nbioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/reports/past_commissions/Research_involving_priso-\nners.pdf] *Research Involving Children (1977) [http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/-\npcbe/reports/past_commissions/Research_involving_children.pdf] *Psychosurgery\nReport and Recommendations (March 1977) [http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/r-\neports/past_commissions/psychosurgery.pdf] *Disclosure of Research Information\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (April 1977) [http://bioethics.georgetown.-\nedu/pcbe/reports/past_commissions/Disclosure_of_Research_Information.pdf]\n*Research Involving Those Institutionalized as Mentally Infirm (1978)\n[http://videocast.nih.gov/pdf/ohrp_research_mentally_infirm.pdf] *Ethical\nGuidelines for the Delivery of Health Services by DHEW (1978) [http://bioethics-\n.georgetown.edu/pcbe/reports/past_commissions/ethical_guidelines_health_service-\ns_min.pdf] *Appendix to Ethical Guidelines for the Delivery of Health Services\nby DHEW (1978) [http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/reports/past_commissions/A-\nppendix_ethical_guidelines.pdf] *Institutional Review Boards (1978)\n[http://videocast.nih.gov/pdf/ohrp_institutional_review_boards.pdf] *Special\nStudy Implications of Advances in Biomedical and Behavioral Research (1978)\n[http://videocast.nih.gov/pdf/ohrp_special_study.pdf] *The Belmont Report:\nEthical Principles and Guidelines for Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical\nand Behavioral Research (1979) [http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html]\n\nThese reports contained their recommendations, The Hastings Center.\n\"Commission Recommendations.\" The Hastings Center Report 5.3 (1975): 45-46.\nJSTOR.

Web. 19 Mar. 2012. a\ndissenting statement and additional statement by commission members and\nsummaries of materials presented to the Commission. An appendix was also\nincluded which contained complete text reports and papers prepared for the\ncommission on the ethical, legal and medical aspects of the different research\nareas examined and other material reviewed by the commission in its\ndeliberations.\n\nThe commission established limits on Biomedical research such that pregnant\nwomen and their fetus' were not harmed by researchers or exposed to any form of\nrisk. The commission further established that the health of a pregnant woman or\nher fetus could not be compromised under any circumstance for the purposes of\nresearch no matter how minute the perceived risk may be. Furthermore, the\ncommission suggested lifting the moratorium imposed on abortion research at that\ntime under the condition that no inducements were offered to subjects to undergo\nan abortion for the purpose of research. However research on a dead fetus or\ndead fetal tissue was approved. Lastly, non-therapeutic research upon a pregnant\nwoman or fetus was approved only under the extenuating circumstance that\nimportant biomedical knowledge could not be obtained through any other means and\nthat permission was granted to researchers by the subject.

Research.\n","linknr":126,"url":"National_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Subjects_of_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research","recorded":1376416834,"links":["/w/index.php?title=National_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Subjects_of_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=National_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Subjects_of_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Subjects_of_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Bioethics","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Tuskegee_Study_of_Untreated_Syphilis_in_the_Negro_Male","/wiki/National_Research_Act","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health,_Education,_and_Welfare","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Health,_Education,_and_Welfare","/wiki/United_States_Congress","/wiki/Fetus","http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/reports/past_commissions/research_fetus.pdf","/wiki/Prison","http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/reports/past_commissions/Research_involving_prisoners.pdf","/wiki/Child","http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/reports/past_commissions/Research_involving_children.pdf","/wiki/Psychosurgery","http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/reports/past_commissions/psychosurgery.pdf","/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)","http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/reports/past_commissions/Disclosure_of_Research_Information.pdf","http://videocast.nih.gov/pdf/ohrp_research_mentally_infirm.pdf","http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/reports/past_commissions/ethical_guidelines_health_services_min.pdf","http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/reports/past_commissions/Appendix_ethical_guidelines.pdf","/wiki/Institutional_review_board","http://videocast.nih.gov/pdf/ohrp_institutional_review_boards.pdf","http://videocast.nih.gov/pdf/ohrp_special_study.pdf","http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Moratorium","#cite_note-5","/wiki/President%27s_Commission_for_the_Study_of_Ethical_Problems_in_Medicine_and_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research","/w/index.php?title=National_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Subjects_of_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=National_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Subjects_of_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Ethical_Advisory_Committee&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Advisory_Committee_on_Human_Radiation_Experiments","/wiki/National_Bioethics_Advisory_Commission","/wiki/President%27s_Council_on_Bioethics","/w/index.php?title=National_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Subjects_of_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=National_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Subjects_of_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/reports/past_commissions/","#cite_ref-2","http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.html","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","/w/index.php?title=National_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Subjects_of_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=National_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Subjects_of_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research&veaction=edit&section=3","http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/archive/irb/irb_introduction.htm/","http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/reports/past_commissions/","http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/archive/nationalcommission.html/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Subjects_of_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research&oldid=548159510","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Medical_ethics","/wiki/Category:Clinical_research","/wiki/Category:Medical_research","/wiki/Category:United_States_national_commissions","/wiki/Category:Ethics_commissio
