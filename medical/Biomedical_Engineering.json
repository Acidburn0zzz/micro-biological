This field seeks to close the gap between\n '[[engineering]]' and '[[medicine]]': It combines the design and problem\n solving skills of engineering with medical and biological sciences to advance\n healthcare treatment, including diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy. [http:-\n //www.prospects.ac.uk/p/types_of_job/biomedical_engineer_job_description.jsp\n Biomedical engineer] prospects\n\nBiomedical engineering has only recently emerged as its own discipline, compared\nto many other engineering fields. Such an evolution is common as a new field\ntransitions from being an interdisciplinary specialization among already-\nestablished fields, to being considered a field in itself. Much of the work in\nbiomedical engineering consists of research and development, spanning a broad\narray of subfields (see below). Prominent biomedical engineering applications\ninclude the development of biocompatible prostheses, various diagnostic and\ntherapeutic medical devices ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants,\ncommon imaging equipment such as MRIs and EEGs, regenerative tissue growth,\npharmaceutical drugs and therapeutic biologicals.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Biomedical_Engineering","recorded":1376428637,"links":[],"instances":["medicine","uk"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biomedical engineering|*","Biological engineering"],"headings":["Notable subdisciplines within biomedical engineering","Regulatory issues","Training and certification","Founding figures","See also","References","Further reading","External links",""],"image":[],"tags":[["implant","medicine"],["chartered_engineer","uk"]],"members":["implant","chartered_engineer"],"related":["Prostate","Engineering_science","Medical_science","Medical_diagnosis","Medical_monitor","Therapy","Interdisciplinarity","Research_and_development","Biocompatible","Prosthesis","Medical_device","MRI","EEG","Medication","Chemical_engineering","Biochemical_engineering","Molecular_engineering","Tissue_engineering","Biomaterials","Transport_phenomena","Electrical_engineering","Computer_Science","Bioelectricity","Neural_engineering","Medical_devices","Optics","Optical_engineering","Medical_devices","Mechanical_engineering","Biomechanics","Transport_phenomena","Medical_devices","Systems_biology","Soft_tissue","Biotechnology","Bioengineering","Fixed-dose_combination","Drug_delivery","Biotechnology","Human_jawbone","BBC_News","Vertebrate_trachea","Artificial_urinary_bladder","CNN","University_of_Chicago","Biological_Systems_Engineering","Neural_engineering","Pharmaceutical_engineering","Chemical_engineering","Artificial_pacemaker","Infusion_pump","Heart-lung_machine","Dialysis","Tissue_engineering","Implant_(medicine)","Artificial_limb","Corrective_lenses","Cochlear_implant","Ocular_prosthetics","Facial_prosthetics","Dental_implant","Electronic_engineering","Electrophysiology","Stereolithography","Postmarketing_surveillance","Medical_device","Electrical_engineering","Diagnostic_imaging","Fluoroscopy","Magnetic_resonance_imaging","Nuclear_medicine","Positron_emission_tomography","Positron_emission_tomography","PET-CT_scanning","X-ray","Computed_tomography","Tomography","Ultrasound","Optical_microscopy","Electron_microscopy","Prosthesis","Transradial_prosthesis","Mechanical_engineering","Biocompatible_material","Ophthalmology","Clinical_engineering","Medical_equipment","Biomedical_Equipment_Technician","Safety_engineering","Electronic_engineering","Electrophysiology","Medical_diagnosis","Consumer_Product_Safety_Commission","European_Union","CE_mark","Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substances_Directive","Member_state_of_the_European_Union","IEC_60601","Bachelor_of_Science_in_Biomedical_Engineering","Medical_school","Undergraduate","ABET","McMaster_University","Undergraduate","Ryerson_University","Graduate_school","Pharmaceutical","Medical_device","Professional_Engineer","Bioengineering","Chartered_Engineer_(UK)","Institution_of_Mechanical_Engineers","Fundamentals_of_Engineering_exam","Leslie_Geddes","Professor_Emeritus","Purdue_University","National_Medal_of_Technology","Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation","Yuan-Cheng_Fung","Professor_emeritus","University_of_California,_San_Diego","Biomechanics","Robert_Langer","Institute_Professor","MIT","Drug_delivery","Tissue_engineering","Wayne_State_University","American_Society_of_Mechanical_Engineers","Nicholas_A._Peppas","Engineering","University_of_Texas_at_Austin","Drug_delivery","Biomaterials","Hydrogels","Nanobiotechnology","Otto_Schmitt","Biomimetics","Ascher_Shapiro","Institute_Professor","MIT","John_G._Webster","Professor_Emeritus","University_of_Wisconsinâ€“Madison","Instrumentation_amplifier","Electrophysiology","Robert_Plonsey","Professor_Emeritus","Duke_University","U._A._Whitaker","Whitaker_Foundation","Frederick_Thurstone","Professor_Emeritus","Duke_University","Engineering","University_of_Texas_at_Austin","Alfred_E._Mann","Forrest_Bird","Mechanical_ventilator","Willem_Johan_Kolff","Hemodialysis","John_James_Rickard_Macleod","Case_Western_Reserve_University","Biomedicine","Cardiophysics","Medical_biophysics","Physiome"]}
