{"cursor":"6288","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Through its program of certification, the 'Educational Commission for\nForeign Medical Graduates' (ECFMG) assesses the readiness of international\nmedical graduates to enter residency or fellowship programs in the United\nStates that are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical\nEducation (ACGME).\n\nECFMG acts as the registration and score-reporting agency for the USMLE for\nforeign medical students/ graduates, or in short, it acts as the designated\nDean's office for International Medical Graduates (IMGs) in contrast to the\nAmerican Medical Graduates (AMGs).\n\nIt conducts three examinations: Step 1, Step 2CK, Step 2CS. The ECFMG\ncertificate is issued to a physician if he or she passes the above the three\nexams within a time period of seven years.\n\nMedical schools in Canada that award the M.D. are not assessed by ECFMG, because\nthe Liaison Committee on Medical Education historically accredited M.D.-granting\ninstitutions in both the U.S. and Canada (today, Canada has its own accrediting\nbody that generally follows U.S. standards). M.D. graduates of American and\nCanadian institutions are not considered IMGs in either country.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates","recorded":1376418982,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Professional_certification","/wiki/Medic","/wiki/Alumnus","/wiki/Residency_(medicine)","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/School_accreditation","/wiki/Accreditation_Council_for_Graduate_Medical_Education","/wiki/United_States_Medical_Licensing_Examination","/wiki/USMLE_Step_1","/wiki/USMLE_Step_2-CK","/wiki/USMLE_Step_2_Clinical_Skills","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine","/wiki/Liaison_Committee_on_Medical_Education","#Certification","#History","#Register_in_International_Medical_Education_Directory","#Communication","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/International_medical_graduate","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Residency_(medicine)","/wiki/National_Resident_Matching_Program","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/USMLE_Step_1","/wiki/USMLE_Step_2_Clinical_Knowledge","/wiki/USMLE_Step_2_Clinical_Skills","/wiki/Medical_education","/wiki/International_Medical_Education_Directory","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_note-established-6","/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&veaction=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&veaction=edit&section=4","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&veaction=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-1","http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/ind_app/verif_new.html","#cite_ref-2","http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/yearly.html","#cite_ref-3","http://www.ecfmg.org/2011ib/ibmec.html","#cite_ref-4","http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/us_seniors/registration.html","#cite_ref-5","http://www.ecfmg.org/annc/ECFMG-release-Feb-28-2012.pdf","#cite_ref-established_6-0","http://web.archive.org/web/20070702170226/http://www.ecfmg.org/2007ib/ibcertnews.html","http://www.ecfmg.org/2007ib/ibcertnews.html","#cite_ref-7","http://www.ecfmg.org/eras/schools-emswp.html","/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&veaction=edit&section=6","http://www.ecfmg.org","http://www.usmle.org","http://www.usmledownload.com","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&action=edit","/wiki/Template:US-org-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:US-org-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:US-org-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Educational_Commission_for_Foreign_Medical_Graduates&oldid=560218111","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Medical_and_health_organizations_based_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:United_States_organization_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Educational+Commission+for+Foreign+Medical+Graduates&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Speci
