It is home to three schools:\nthe School of Medicine, the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, the Graduate\nSchool of Nursing; a biomedical research enterprise; and a range of public-\nservice initiatives throughout the state. One of the fastest-growing academic\nhealth centers in the country, UMMS is located in Worcester, Massachusetts;\nother UMass sites are located in Amherst, Boston, Dartmouth and Lowell. UMMS is\nalso known as UMass Worcester.\n\nUMMS is ranked 7th in primary-care education and 48th in research among the\nUnited States' 125 medical schools in the 2012 [[U.S. News & World Report]]\nannual guide, \"Americaâs Best Graduate Schoolsâ. UMMS is also a research center.\nDuring the past four decades UMMS researchers have made advances in a broad\nrange of disease families, from HIV and infectious diseases to cancer, genetic\ndisorders, diabetes and immune disease. UMMS faculty discovered the link between\nthe immune system and type-1 diabetes, found the genetic cause underlying the\nthird-most-common form of the muscular dystrophies, established the fundamental\ndifference between HIV and other retroviruses and co-discovered RNA interference\n(RNAi) (a naturally occurring gene-silencing process which has become a tool in\nresearch focused on such areas as diabetes, HIV/AIDS and cancer). UMMS\nscientists are making strides in collaborative efforts to develop vaccines for\navian flu, HIV, West Nile virus and rabies.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"University_of_Massachusetts_Medical_School","recorded":1376418401,"links":[],"instances":["natural_sciences","massachusetts"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Educational institutions established in 1962","Schools of medicine in Massachusetts","University of Massachusetts|Medical School","Universities and colleges in Worcester, Massachusetts|University of Massachusetts Medical School","New England Association of Schools and Colleges","University of Massachusetts Medical School|","Public universities and colleges in Massachusetts|University of Massachusetts Medical School","Buildings and structures in Worcester, Massachusetts","Hospitals in Worcester, Massachusetts"],"headings":["History","Academics","Research","MassBiologics","Public service","Faculty","{{anchor|Teaching Affiliates and Clinical Partners}}Teaching affiliates and clinical partners","Campus","Administration","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["protocol","natural_sciences"],["route_9","massachusetts"]],"members":["protocol","route_9"],"related":["Robert_L._Caret","Worcester,_Massachusetts","University_of_Massachusetts","University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst","University_of_Massachusetts_Boston","University_of_Massachusetts_Dartmouth","University_of_Massachusetts_Lowell","UMass_Memorial_Health_Care","Central_Massachusetts","Shrewsbury,_Massachusetts","Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill","Liaison_Committee_on_Medical_Education","Doctor_of_Medicine","U.S._News_&_World_Report","Advanced_practice_nurse","Pathophysiology","Craig_Mello","Howard_Hughes_Medical_Institute","Andrew_Fire","Carnegie_Institution","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","University_of_Massachusetts","Cancer","Quality_Assurance_Review_Center","Lincoln,_Rhode_Island","Radiotherapy","Protocol_(natural_sciences)","National_Cancer_Institute","National_Institutes_of_Health","Clostridium_difficile","Actoxumab","Bezlotoxumab","Nobel_Prize","RNA_Interference","Wiley_Prize","Gairdner_Foundation_International_Award","ISI_Highly_Cited","Primary_care","Central_Massachusetts","Western_Massachusetts","Route_9_(Massachusetts)","Worcester,_Massachusetts","American_College_of_Surgeons","Level_I_Trauma_Center","Clinton,_Massachusetts","Fitchburg,_Massachusetts","Leominster,_Massachusetts","Marlborough,_Massachusetts","Palmer,_Massachusetts","Lamar_Soutter","Aaron_Lazare","UMass_Memorial_Health_Care"]}
