{"cursor":"10280","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'Biomedical Equipment Technician/Technologist', also referred to as a\n'Biomedical Engineering Technician/Technologist (BMET)' or 'Biomedical\nEquipment/Engineering Specialist (BES or BMES)' is typically an electro-\nmechanical technician or technologist who ensures that medical equipment is well-\nmaintained, properly configured, and safely functional. In hospital or clinical\nenvironments BMETs often work with Clinical Engineers, though as in most\ntechnical fields there is a professional and legal distinction between engineers\nand engineering technicians/technologists.\n\nBMETs are employed by hospitals, clinics, private sector companies, and the\nmilitary. These persons install, inspect, maintain, repair, calibrate, modify\nand design biomedical equipment and support systems to adhere to medical\nstandard guidelines. Biomeds are involved in the total management of healthcare\ntechnology beyond repairs and scheduled maintenance; such as, capitol asset\nplanning, project management, budgeting and personnel management, designing\ninterfaces and integrating medical systems, training end-users to utilize\nmedical technology, and evaluating new devices for acquisition. BMETs educate\nand advise staff and other agencies on theory of operation, physiological\nprinciples, and safe clinical application of biomedical equipment maintaining\nthe facility's patient care and medical staff equipment.\n\nThe acceptance of the BMET in the private sector was given a big push in 1970\nwhen consumer advocate Ralph Nader wrote an article in which he claimed, \"At\nleast 1,200 people a year are electrocuted and many more are killed or injured\nin needless electrical accidents in hospitals.\"\n\nBMETs cover a vast array of different fields and devices. However, in many cases\nthere is a separation of responsibilities whereby other (more specific)\nspecialists focus on certain kinds of medical technology -- i.e., an Imaging\nRepair Specialist works strictly on medical imaging equipment, and typically\ncomes from an Imaging background, either from the military, or an OEM. An\nImaging Repair Specialist usually does not have much, if any, biomedical\ntraining. However, there are situations where a BMET has cross-trained into the\nImaging field.\n\nExamples of different areas of Medical equipment technology are: *Diagnostic\nImaging: **Radiographic and Fluoroscopic X-ray, **Diagnostic ultrasound,\n**Mammography, **Nuclear Imaging, **Positron emission tomography (PET),\n**Medical imaging, **Computed Tomography (CT), Linear Tomography, **Picture\narchiving and communication systems (PACS), **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI\nscanner), *Physiological monitoring, *Electron microscope, *Sterilization,\n*LASERs, *Dental, *Telemedicine, *Heart Lung Device, *DaVinci Surgical Robot,\n*Optometry, *Surgical Instruments, *Infusion pumps, *Anesthesia, *Laboratory,\n*Dialysis, *Respiratory Services (ventilators), *Computer Networking Systems\nintegration, *Information Technology, *Patient Monitoring, *Cardiac Diagnostics,\n\nBMETs work closely with nursing staff, and Medical Material personnel to obtain\nparts, supplies, and equipment and even closer with facility management to\ncoordinate equipment installations requiring certain facility\nrequirements/modifications.\n","linknr":137,"url":"Biomedical_Equipment_Technician","recorded":1376421006,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_Equipment_Technician","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Technician","/wiki/Medical_equipment","/wiki/Clinical_Engineering","/wiki/Regulation_and_licensure_in_engineering","/wiki/Engineer","/wiki/Technician","/wiki/Ralph_Nader","/wiki/Radiography","/wiki/Fluoroscopy","/wiki/Diagnostic_ultrasound","/wiki/Mammography","/wiki/Nuclear_medicine","/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography","/wiki/Medical_imaging","/wiki/Computed_Tomography","/wiki/Tomography","/wiki/Picture_archiving_and_communication_system","/wiki/Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging","/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)","/wiki/Heart_lung_machine","/wiki/Da_Vinci_Surgical_System","/wiki/Optometry","/wiki/Infusion_pump","/wiki/Anesthesia","/w/index.php?title=Medical_Material&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Facility_management","#Regulatory_issues","#Biomedical_equipment_technology_training","#Professional_certification","#Employment","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&veaction=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/Medical_equipment_management","/wiki/Clinical_engineering","/wiki/Biomedical_Engineering","/wiki/Clinical_Engineering","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&veaction=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&veaction=edit&section=4","/wiki/OEM","/wiki/OEM","http://www.aimsced.com/biomed.htm","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&veaction=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&veaction=edit&section=6","http://www.aami.org/","http://www.mymeta.org/","http://www.icis-biomed.org/","http://www.ebme.co.uk/","http://www.trimedxfoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&oldid=568041142","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Logistics","/wiki/Category:Healthcare_occupations","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_July_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Biomedical+Equipment+Technician&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Biomedical+Equipment+Technician","/wiki/Biomedical_Equipment_Technician","/wiki/Talk:Biomedical_Equipment_Technician","#","/wiki/Biomedical_Equipment_Technician","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Biomedical_Equipment_Technician&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Content
