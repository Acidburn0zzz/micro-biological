With origins in ancient Egypt, it was originally based on the\nbreadth of a human hand. It is today equal to four inches, and thus, following\nthe adoption of the international inch in 1959, it is equal to exactly\n10.16 centimetres. It may be abbreviated to \"h\" or \"hh\".\nAlthough measurements between whole hands are usually expressed in what appears\nto be decimal format, the subdivision of the hand is not decimal but is in base\n4, so subdivisions after the radix point are in quarters of a hand, which are\ninches. Thus, 62 inches is fifteen and a half hands, or 15.2\nhh (normally said as \"fifteen-two\", or occasionally in full as \"fifteen hands\ntwo inches\")\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Hand_(unit)","recorded":1376418418,"links":[],"instances":["unit","unit","unit","horse","genus","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Customary units of measurement in the United States","Horses","Human-based units of measurement","Imperial units","Units of length"],"headings":["Terminology","History","Use in measuring horses","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["palm","length"],["digit","unit"],["finger","unit"],["palm","unit"],["equus","genus"],["mane","horse"],["span","unit"]],"members":["finger","digit","palm","mane","equus","span"],"related":["SI","Unit_of_measurement","Length","Australia","Canada","United_Kingdom","United_States","Ancient_Egypt","Human","Radix","Radix","Radix_point","Turin","Anthropic_units","Male","Human","Ancient_Egyptian_units_of_measurement","Palm_(length)","Digit_(unit)","Finger_(unit)","Exegesis","Authorized_Version","Palm_(unit)","Henry_VIII","Georges-Louis_Leclerc,_Comte_de_Buffon","Horse","Pony","Equus_(genus)","Australia","Canada","Ireland","International_Federation_for_Equestrian_Sports","South_Africa","Withers","Mane_(horse)","Fédération_Equestre_Internationale","United_States_Equestrian_Federation","Anthropic_units","List_of_horse_breeds","Pony","Span_(unit)"]}
