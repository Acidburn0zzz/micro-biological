Most of the species grow in damp ground, in marshes or in water.\n\nSeveral of the species are extremely poisonous, the active poison being\noenanthotoxin. The most notable of these is O. crocata, which lives in damp,\nmarshy ground, and resembles celery with roots like a bunch of large white\ncarrots. The leaves may be eaten safely by livestock, but the stems, and\nespecially the carbohydrate-rich roots are much more poisonous. Animals familiar\nwith eating the leaves may eat the roots when these are exposed during ditch\nclearance â€“ one root is sufficient to kill a cow, and human fatalities are\nalso known. It has been referred to as the most poisonous of all British\nplants, and is considered\nparticularly dangerous because of its similarity to several edible\nplants.\n\nThe species [[Oenanthe javanica|O. javanica]], commonly known as Chinese celery\nor Japanese parsley (seri; not to be confused with mitsuba or Japanese wild\ncelery, a plant from a different genus) is edible and grown in several countries\nof eastern Asia, as well as in Italy and India, where the spring growth is\nrelished as a vegetable.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"water_dropwort","recorded":1376418366,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Apiaceae","Poisonous plants"],"headings":["Names","Sardonic grin","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Plantae","Angiosperms","Eudicots","Asterids","Apiales","Apiaceae","Genus","Apiaceae","Species","Poisonous","Oenanthotoxin","Celery","Carrot","Livestock","Cow","Cryptotaenia","Asia","Italy","India","Dropwort","University_of_Eastern_Piedmont","Italy","Risus_sardonicus","Neurotoxin","Human_sacrifice","Phoenicia","Sardinia","Substance_intoxication","Corky-fruited_water_dropwort"]}
