{"cursor":"2014","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Tournament selection' is a method of selecting an individual from a population\nof individuals in a genetic algorithm. Tournament selection involves running\nseveral \"tournaments\" among a few individuals chosen at random from the\npopulation. The winner of each tournament (the one with the best fitness) is\nselected for crossover. Selection pressure is easily adjusted by changing the\ntournament size. If the tournament size is larger, weak individuals have a\nsmaller chance to be selected.\n\nTournament selection pseudo code:\n\n choose k (the tournament size) individuals from the population at random choose\n the best individual from pool/tournament with probability p choose the second\n best individual with probability p*(1-p) choose the third best individual with\n probability p*((1-p)^2) and so on...\n\nDeterministic tournament selection selects the best individual (when p=1) in any\ntournament. A 1-way tournament (k=1) selection is equivalent to random\nselection. The chosen individual can be removed from the population that the\nselection is made from if desired, otherwise individuals can be selected more\nthan once for the next generation.\n\nTournament selection has several benefits: it is efficient to code, works on\nparallel architectures and allows the selection pressure to be easily adjusted.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Tournament_selection","recorded":1376428018,"links":[],"instances":["genetic_algorithm"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetic algorithms"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["crossover","genetic_algorithm"]],"members":["crossover"],"related":["Genetic_algorithm","Crossover_(genetic_algorithm)","Fitness_proportionate_selection","Reward-based_selection"]}
