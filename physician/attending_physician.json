{"cursor":"2251","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In the United States and Canada, an 'attending physician' (also known as an\n'attending', 'rendering doc', or 'staff physician') is a physician (D.O. or\nM.D.) who has completed residency and practises medicine in a clinic or\nhospital, in the specialty learned during residency. An attending physician can\nsupervise fellows, residents, and medical students. Attending physicians may\nalso have an academic title at an affiliated university such as \"professor\".\nThis is common if the supervision of trainees is a significant part of the\nphysician's work. Attending physicians have final responsibility, legally and\notherwise, for patient care, even when many of the minute-to-minute decisions\nare being made by subordinates (physician assistants, resident physicians, nurse\npractitioners, and medical students). Attending physicians are sometimes the\n'rendering physician' listed on the patient's official medical record, but if\nthey are overseeing a resident or another staff member, they are 'supervising.'\n\nAttending physicians may also still be in training, such as a fellow in a\nsubspecialty. For example, a cardiology fellow may function as an internal\nmedicine attending, as he or she has already finished residency in internal\nmedicine. The term is used more commonly in teaching hospitals. In non-teaching\nhospitals, essentially all physicians function as attendings in some respects\nafter completing residency.\n\nThe term \"attending physician\" or \"attending\" also refers to the formal\nrelationship of a hospitalized patient and their primary doctor during the\nhospitalization, as opposed to ancillary physicians assisting the primary\ndoctor. However, even on a consultation service, at an academic center, the\nphysician who has finished his training is called the attending or consultant,\nas opposed to a resident physician.\n","linknr":97,"url":"attending_physician","recorded":1376418996,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Attending_physician&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Attending_physician&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attending_physician","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Physician","/wiki/Residency_(medicine)","/wiki/Medicine","/wiki/Clinic","/wiki/Hospital","/wiki/Fellowship_(medicine)","/wiki/Residency_(medicine)","/wiki/Medical_students","/wiki/Physician_assistant","/wiki/Residency_(medicine)","/wiki/Cardiology","/wiki/Internal_medicine","/wiki/Teaching_hospital","/wiki/Primary_care_physician","/w/index.php?title=Attending_physician&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Attending_physician&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Consultant_(medicine)","/wiki/Attending_physician_statement","/wiki/Residency_(medicine)","/wiki/Fellowship_(medicine)","/w/index.php?title=Attending_physician&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Attending_physician&veaction=edit&section=2","http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/attending+physician","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Attending_physician&oldid=566656183","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Physicians","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Attending+physician&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Attending+physician","/wiki/Attending_physician","/wiki/Talk:Attending_physician","#","/wiki/Attending_physician","/w/index.php?title=Attending_physician&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Attending_physician&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Attending_physician&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Attending_physician","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Attending_physician","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Attending_physician&oldid=566656183","/w/index.php?title=Attending_physician&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q460628","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Attending_physician&id=566656183","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Attending+physician","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Attending+physician&oldid=566656183&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Attending_physician&printable=yes","//da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overl%C3%A6ge","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberarzt","//no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlege","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q460628#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attending_physician","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["medicine","medicine","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Physicians"],"headings":["See
