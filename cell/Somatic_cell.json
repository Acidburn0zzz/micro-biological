For example, in mammals,\n'somatic' cells make up all the internal organs, skin, bones, blood and\nconnective tissue. By contrast, mammalian germ cells give rise to spermatozoa\nand ova which fuse during fertilization to produce a cell called a zygote, which\ndevelops into an embryo. Somatic cells are diploid.\n\nThe word \"somatic\" is derived from the Greek word sÅma, meaning \"body\".\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Somatic_cell","recorded":1376427762,"links":[],"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cloning","Cells","Developmental biology","Genetics"],"headings":["Genetics and chromosome content","Cloning","References","See also"],"image":[],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Cell_(biology)","Multicellular_organism","Gamete","Germ_cell","Gametocyte","Stem_cell","Sexual_reproduction","Germ_cells","Stem_cells","Mammal","Spermatozoa","Ovum","Fertilization","Zygote","Embryo","Diploid","Greek_language","DNA","Chromosome","Diploid","Haploid","Chromosomes","Zygote","Species","Tetraploid","Hexaploid","Wheat","Chromatid","Cloning","Somatic_cell_nuclear_transfer","Cell_nucleus","Ovum","Diploid","Chromosomes","Uterus","Mitochondria","Dolly_the_Sheep","Snuppy","Dog","Somatic_cell_count"]}
