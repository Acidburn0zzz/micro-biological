Sickling decreases the\ncells' flexibility and results in a risk of various complications. The sickling\noccurs because of a mutation in the haemoglobin gene. Individuals with one copy\nof the defunct gene display both normal and abnormal haemoglobin. This is an\nexample of codominance.\n\nLife expectancy is shortened. In 1994, in the US, the average life expectancy of\npersons with this condition was estimated to be 42 years in males and 48 years\nin females, but today, thanks to better management of the disease,\npatients can live into their 70s or beyond. http://ericksontribune.com/2007/10/mds-launch-network-to-treat-\nsickle-cell/\n\nSickle-cell disease occurs more commonly among people whose ancestors lived in\ntropical and sub-tropical sub-saharan regions where malaria is or was common.\nWhere malaria is common, carrying a single sickle-cell gene (sickle cell trait)\nconfers a fitness. Specifically, humans with one of the two alleles of sickle-\ncell disease show less severe symptoms when infected with malaria.\n\nSickle-cell anaemia is a form of sickle-cell disease in which there is\nhomozygosity for the mutation that causes HbS. Sickle-cell anaemia is also\nreferred to as \"HbSS\", \"SS disease\", \"haemoglobin S\" or permutations of those\nnames. In heterozygous people, that is, those who have only one sickle gene and\none normal adult haemoglobin gene, the condition is referred to as \"HbAS\" or\n\"sickle cell trait\". Other, rarer forms of sickle-cell disease are compound\nheterozygous states in which the person has only one copy of the mutation that\ncauses HbS and one copy of another abnormal haemoglobin allele. They include sickle-\nhaemoglobin C disease (HbSC), sickle beta-plus-thalassaemia (HbS/Î² +)\nand sickle beta-zero-thalassaemia (HbS/Î² 0).\n\nThe term disease is applied because the inherited abnormality causes a\npathological condition that can lead to death and severe complications. Not all\ninherited variants of haemoglobin are detrimental, a concept known as genetic\npolymorphism.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"sickle_cell_disease","recorded":1376418421,"links":[],"instances":["region","biology","medical","genetics","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Autosomal recessive disorders","Chronic pain syndromes","Hereditary hemolytic anemias","Health in Africa","Hematopathology","Disorders of globin and globulin proteins"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Pathophysiology","Genetics","Diagnosis","Management","Prognosis","Epidemiology","History","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["fitness","biology"],["syncope","medicine"],["transcription","genetics"],["hypoxia","medical"],["transfusion_therapy","sickle-cell_disease"],["île-de-france","region"]],"members":["fitness","hypoxia","transcription","syncope","transfusion_therapy"],"related":["Blood_disorder","Red_blood_cell","Sickle","Mutation","Haemoglobin","Gene","Codominance","Tropical","Sub-tropical","Malaria","Sickle_cell_trait","Fitness_(biology)","Alleles","Homozygote","Genetic_mutation","Heterozygous","Compound_heterozygous","Haemoglobin","Allele","Haemoglobin_C","Thalassaemia","Haemoglobin","Genetic_polymorphism","Vaso-occlusive_crisis","Reticulocytopenia","Vaso-occlusive_crisis","Ischemia","Pain","Necrosis","Analgesic","Blood_transfusion","Opiate","NSAID","Diclofenac","Naproxen","Patient-controlled_analgesia","Diphenhydramine","Incentive_spirometer","Atelectasis","Spleen","Infarction","Autosplenectomy","Encapsulated_organisms","Asplenia","Pallor","Parvovirus_B19","Erythropoiesis","Reticulocyte","Reticulocytopenia","G6PD_deficiency","Dactylitis","Acute_chest_syndrome","Chest_X-ray","Overwhelming_post-splenectomy_infection","Penicillin","Stroke","Human_brain","Silent_stroke","Cholelithiasis","Cholecystitis","Bilirubin","Haemolysis","Aseptic_bone_necrosis","Immune_system","Hyposplenism","Priapism","Infarction","Penis","Osteomyelitis","Opioid","Renal_papillary_necrosis","Intrauterine_growth_retardation","Abortion","Pre-eclampsia","Pulmonary_hypertension","Pulmonary_artery","Right_ventricle","Heart_failure","Syncope_(medicine)","Renal_failure","Sickle_cell_nephropathy","Hypertension","Proteinuria","Hematuria","Sickle_cell_trait","Isosthenuria","Point_mutation","Haemoglobin","Glutamic_acid","Valine","Chromosome_11","Wild-type","Ischaemia","Hemolysis","Bone_marrow","Heterozygous","Genetic_carrier","Allele","Homozygous","Doughnut","Capillary","Dehydration","Mutation","Nucleotide","Single-nucleotide_polymorphism","Glutamic_acid","Valine","Mutation","Codon","Transcription_(genetics)","Secondary_structure","Tertiary_structure","Quaternary_structure","Oxygen","Oxygen","Polymerization","Allele","Genetic_carrier","Africa","Mediterranean","India","Middle_East","Plasmodium","United_States","West_Africa","Natural_selection","United_States","Complete_blood_count","Haemoglobin","Reticulocyte","Blood_film","Hyposplenism","Codocyte","Howell-Jolly_body","Sodium_metabisulfite","Sodium_dithionite","Haemoglobin","Haemoglobin_electrophoresis","Gel_electrophoresis","Haemoglobin_C","High-performance_liquid_chromatography","Genetic_testing","Occult","Genetic_counseling","Blood","Fetus","Amniotic_fluid","U.S._Air_Force","Folic_acid","Analgesic","Opioid","NSAID","Diclofenac","Naproxen","Patient-controlled_analgesia","Diphenhydramine","Hypoxia_(medical)","Blood_transfusion","Exchange_transfusion","Hydroxyurea","Fetal_haemoglobin","Chemotherapy","Blood_transfusion","Transfusion_therapy_(Sickle-cell_disease)","Transcranial_Doppler","Ultrasonography","Bone_marrow_transplant","Haemophilia","Cystic_fibrosis","World_Health_Organization","Prevalence","United_States","National_Institutes_of_Health","Europe","France","Overseas_departments_and_territories_of_France","North_Africa","Sub-Saharan_Africa","Phenylketonuria","Hypothyroidism","Adrenal_hyperplasia","Cystic_fibrosis","Île-de-France_(region)","Provence-Alpes-Côte_d'Azur","Brittany","Thalassemia","James_B._Herrick","Ernest_Edward_Irons","Anaemia","Dentistry","Pneumonia","Sauteurs","Verne_Mason","Johns_Hopkins_Hospital","Autopsy","Linus_Pauling","History_of_molecular_biology","Sickle_Cell_Anemia,_a_Molecular_Disease","Hematopoietic_ulcer"]}
