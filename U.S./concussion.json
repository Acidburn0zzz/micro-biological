The terms 'mild brain injury', 'mild\ntraumatic brain injury' ('MTBI'), 'mild head injury' ('MHI'), 'minor head\ntrauma', and 'concussion' may be used interchangeably,\n\n although the last is often treated as a narrower\ncategory. Although the term \"concussion\" is still used in\nsports literature as interchangeable with \"MHI\" or \"MTBI\", the general clinical\nmedical literature now uses \"MTBI\" instead. In this\narticle, \"concussion\" and \"MTBI\" are used interchangeably. Frequently defined as\na head injury with a temporary loss of brain function, concussion causes a\nvariety of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, which may not be\nrecognized if subtle.\n\nTreatment involves monitoring as well as physical and cognitive rest\n(reduction of such activities as school work, playing video games and text\nmessaging). Symptoms usually resolve\nwithin three weeks, though they may persist or complications may occur. {{cite journal|author=Anderson T, Heitger M, Macleod AD\n|year=2006\n|url=http://www.vanderveer.org.nz/research/publications/papers/0344.pdf\n|title=Concussion and mild head injury |journal=Practical Neurology\n|volume=6 |pages=342â57 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2006.106583 |issue=6 }} \n\nThose who have had one concussion seem more susceptible to another, especially\nif the new injury occurs before symptoms from the previous concussion have\ncompletely resolved. There is also a\nnegative progressive process in which smaller impacts cause the same symptom\nseverity. Repeated concussions may\nincrease the risk in later life for dementia, Parkinson's disease, and/or\ndepression.\n\nA variety of signs accompany concussion including somatic (such as headache),\ncognitive (such as feeling in a fog), emotional (such as emotional\nchangeability), physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia),\nbehavioral changes (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed\nreaction times), and/or sleep disturbances. A 2010 Pediatrics review article focussing on children and\nadolescents noted that fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions had\nassociated loss of consciousness.\n\nDue to varying definitions and possible underreporting, the rate at which\nconcussion occurs annually is not accurately known, but is estimated to be more\nthan 6 per 1,000 people. Common causes include sports\ninjuries, bicycle accidents, car accidents, and falls, the latter two being the\nmost frequent among adults. In addition to a blow to the\nhead, concussion may be caused by acceleration forces without a direct impact,\nand on the battlefield, MTBI is a potential consequence of nearby\nexplosions.\n\nIt is not known whether the brain in concussion is structurally damaged or\nwhether there is mainly a loss of function with only physiological changes. {{Cite journal|author=Shaw NA |title=The neurophysiology of\nconcussion |journal=Progress in Neurobiology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=281â344\n|year=2002 |pmid=12207973 |doi=10.1016/S0301-0082(02)00018-7 }} Cellular\ndamage has reportedly been found in concussed brains, but it may have been due\nto artifacts from the studies.
