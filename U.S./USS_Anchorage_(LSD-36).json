She\nwas lead ship of the ''Anchorage''-class as well as the second ship (USS Juneau\nCL-52 being the first) in the navy to be named after the city in Alaska.\n\nAnchorage was awarded to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi on 29\nJune 1965 and her keel was laid down on 13 March 1967. She was launched on 5 May\n1968 and commissioned on 15 March 1969.\n\nOutfitted with a large floodable stern section accessed through an enormous\noperable stern gate, Anchorage served as a launch platform for large landing\ncraft, such as the LCU, as well as a \"boat haven\" to shelter other small craft\nutilized in an amphibious landing. The ship was able to provide a minimal degree\nof naval gunfire support through the use of two sets of twin 3\"/50 guns mounted\non the 02-level fore and aft. In later years these guns were removed to be\nreplaced with Mk-38 machine guns and two Phalanx CIWS for missile defense. In\nits final decade of service with the US Navy, it functioned primarily as a\nplatform for two LCAC hovercraft landing vehicles and embarked Marines.\n\nIn the ship's 34 years of service, she completed 19 deployments in the western\nPacific and became the most decorated dock landing ship on the west coast.\n\nAnchorage participated in numerous military operations. At the end of the\nVietnam War, the ship carried Marines back to the United States as a part of the\nUS withdrawal from Vietnam.\n\nIn April 1975, Anchorage participated in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation\nof Saigon, Vietnam. [http://www.history.navy.mil/seairland/chap5.htm By Sea,\nAir and Land: An Illustrated History of the U.S. Navy and the war in Southeast\nAsia Chapter 5: The Final Curtain, 1973-1975]\n\nIn 1991, she served in Operation Desert Storm and later in 2000 she was used to\nassist the following her bombing in Yemen.\n\nIn 1994, she served in Operation Continue Hope in Mogadishu, Somalia. Also while\nthere assisted in Operation Quick Draw and Distant Runner with the Hotel Rwanda\nincident and Burundi.\n\nIn 1996, following completion of a deployment during which she supported\nOperation Southern Watch in the Persian Gulf, Anchorage entered drydock for its\nfinal drydock planned maintenance availability during which it received numerous\nsystems upgrades and modifications.\n\nIn July 2003, Anchorage returned to its home port at San Diego, California after\nsupporting Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. She was\ndecommissioned on 1 October 2003.\n\nAnchorage was approved for transfer to Taiwan by the United States Senate in\nNovember 2003. Anchorage was scheduled to replace the former , now Chung Cheng,\nhowever the transfer never took place and Anchorage remained at the Inactive\nShips Maintenance Facility at Pearl Harbor.\n\nOn 17 July 2010, Anchorage was used as a target during RIMPAC for\nMaverick and Harpoon missiles fired from US Patrol Squadrons VP-5 and\nVP-40.
