{"cursor":"5677","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Boris Ephrussi' (; 9 May 1901 â 2 May 1979), Professor of Genetics at the\nUniversity of Paris, was a Russo-French geneticist.\n\nBoris was born on May 9, 1901 into a Jewish family. His father, Samuil Osipovich\nEphrussi, was a chemical engineer; his grandfather, Joseph Ephrusi (Efrusi), was\nthe founder of a banking dynasty in Kishinev. He published two papers in\nNovember 1966 which represented a key step in a decade of research in his\nlaboratory. This research helped transform mammalian, and especially human,\ngenetics. Burian R. 1990. Boris Ephrussi and the Foundations of\nDevelopmental Genetics. In Gilbert S. (ed) Developmental Biology, New York,\nPlenum. Sapp J. 1987. Beyond the gene: cytoplasmic inheritance and the\nstruggle for authority in genetics. New York, Oxford University Press.\n\nBoris started his scientific training as a Russian Ã©migrÃ© in 1920. He studied\nthe initiation and regulation of embryological processes by intracellular and\nextracellular factors. A major strand of his early research concerned the effect\nof temperature on the development of fertilized sea urchin eggs. In this work he\nused a micromanipulator, which was developed by Robert Chambers, an American\nbiologist.\n\nDuring Ephrussi's time, writing a second dissertation was standard practice in\nFrance. Ephrussi's involved culturing tissues. Ephrussi ran into difficulties\ntypically associated with early tissue culture techniques, but despite these\nobstacles Ephrussi managed to conclude from studies of brachyury in mice that\nintrinsic factors (i.e. genes) play a key role in development.\n\nAs the next phase of his career, Ephrussi coupled his embryological concerns\nwith a firm conviction that one must understand the role of genes in order to\ndecipher embryological processes. He moved to Caltech in 1934 and stayed until\n1935 to learn genetics within the intellectual empire of T.H. Morgan. This move\nwas supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. During this period he conducted\nimportant work with George Beadle, who joined him in Paris in the autumn of\n1935. There they produced results from experiments with Drosophila eye\ntransplants. Ephrussi B. 1939. GÃ©nÃ©tique physiologique. Paris,\nHermann. This became integral to the work of Beadle and Tatum, who were\nworking with Neurospora, and from this research developed the 'one gene, one\nenzyme' hypothesis.\n\nDuring World War II, Ephrussi spent most of his time as a refugee at Johns\nHopkins University. Following this he began work in France on yeast and\ncytoplasmic genetics. He began working at the Institut de Biologie\nPhysicochimique (the Rothschild Institute) in Paris, and later worked at the\nCNRS at Gif-sur-Yvette, where he studied the contribution of cytoplasm to the\ncell phenotype and pursued the interactions between nuclear and cytoplasmic\ngenetic endowments necessary to the yielding of an intact, functioning (albeit\nsingle-celled) organism. Ephrussi B. 1953. Nucleo-cytoplasmic relations in\nmicro-organisms: their bearing on cell heredity and differentiation.\nOxford.\n\nEphrussi continued to work on the topics he was primarily interested until the\nlate 1970s. Topics covered included\n\n*using hybrids with teratomas to explore determination and differentiation (e.g.\nFinch and Ephrussi 1967; Kahan and Ephrussi 1970). *negative regulation of\ndifferentiated function (e.g. Davidson, Ephrussi and Yamamoto 1966; Fougbre,\nRuiz and Ephrussi 1972). *cellular and genetic biological approaches over a\ndirect attack at the molecular level (Ephrussi 1970, page 12).\n\nIn 1974 Ephrussi won a Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University.\nEphrussi lived to see that transplantation was transforming into a genetic tool\nthat would take on a new and more powerful aspect in the molecular era. However\nhe died before seeing the genetic advances made by DNA recombination studies\nwhich had been set in motion by the studies he had undertaken. It can be said\nthat Ephrussi was a pioneer of embryology and a main contributor to the\nreconciliation of modern genetics and Embryology.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Boris_Ephrussi","recorded":1376425845,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Boris_Ephrussi&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Boris_Ephrussi&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Ephrussi","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Russian_language","/wiki/University_of_Paris","/wiki/Russians","/wiki/France","/wiki/Genetics","/wiki/Jewish","/wiki/Kishinev","/wiki/Mammal","/wiki/Human","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Science","/wiki/%C3%89migr%C3%A9","/wiki/Embryo","/wiki/Intracellular","/wiki/Extracellular","/wiki/Fertilisation","/wiki/Sea_urchin","/wiki/Egg_(biology)","/wiki/Robert_Chambers_(disambiguation)","//toolserver.org/%7Edispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py?page=Boris_Ephrussi&editintro=Template:Disambiguation_needed/editintro&client=Template:Dn","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Dissertation","/wiki/Tissue_culture","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Ephrussi#endnote_1935a","/wiki/Brachyury","/wiki/Mouse","/wiki/Genes","/wiki/Developmental_biology","/wiki/Career","/wiki/Caltech","/wiki/T.H._Morgan","/wiki/Rockefeller_Foundation","/wiki/George_Beadle","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster","/wiki/Organ_transplant","#cite_note-3","/wiki/George_Wells_Beadle","/wiki/Edward_Lawrie_Tatum","/wiki/Neurospora","/wiki/One_gene,_one_enzyme","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Refugee","/wiki/Yeast","/wiki/Cytoplasm","/w/index.php?title=Institut_de_Biologie_Physicochimique&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/CNRS","/wiki/Gif-sur-Yvette","/wiki/Phenotype","/wiki/Cell_nucleus","/wiki/Amoeba","/wiki/Organism","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)","/wiki/Teratoma","/wiki/Molecule","/wiki/Louisa_Gross_Horwitz_Prize","/wiki/Columbia_University","/wiki/Embryology","/w/index.php?title=Boris_Ephrussi&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Boris_Ephrussi&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#ref_1935a","/w/index.php?title=Boris_Ephrussi&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Boris_Ephrussi&veaction=edit&section=2","http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/horwitz/","http://picardp1.mouchez.cnrs.fr/Burian-Gayon.html","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/69067880","/wiki/Integrated_Authority_File","http://d-nb.info/gnd/151099448","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boris_Ephrussi&oldid=560869344","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1901_births","/wiki/Category:1979_deaths","/wiki/Category:Ephrussi_family","/wiki/Category:French_biologists","/wiki/Category:French_geneticists","/wiki/Category:French_Jews","/wiki/Category:University_of_Paris_faculty","/wiki/Category:French_people_of_Moldovan_descent","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Russian-language_text","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_links_needing_disambiguation_from_June_2011","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_June_2011","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_GND_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Boris+Ephrussi&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Boris+Ephrussi","/wiki/Boris_Ephrussi","/wiki/Talk:Boris_Ephrussi","#","/wiki/Boris_Ephrussi","/w/index.php?title=Boris_Ephrussi&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Boris_Ephrussi&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Boris_Ephrussi&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Boris_Ephrussi","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Boris_Ephrussi","/wik
