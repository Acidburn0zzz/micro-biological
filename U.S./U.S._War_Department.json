The War Department also bore responsibility for naval\naffairs until the establishment of the Navy Department in 1798 and for most land-\nbased air forces until the creation of the Department of the Air Force in 1947.\nThe Secretary of War headed the war department throughout its existence.\n\nThe War Department existed from 1789 until September 18, 1947, when it split\ninto Department of the Army and Department of the Air Force and joined the\nDepartment of the Navy as part of the new joint National Military Establishment\n(NME), renamed the United States Department of Defense in 1949.\n\nThe Secretary of War, a civilian with such responsibilities as finance and\npurchases and a minor role in directing military affairs, headed the War\nDepartment.\n","linknr":256,"url":"U.S._War_Department","recorded":1376428235,"links":["/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_War","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=U.S._War_Department&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Usdowseal.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Usdowseal.jpg","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Army","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Air_Force","/wiki/United_States_Army","/wiki/United_States_Air_Force","/wiki/File:Seal_of_the_US_Department_of_the_Army.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Seal_of_the_US_Department_of_the_Army.svg/150px-Seal_of_the_US_Department_of_the_Army.svg.png","/wiki/File:Seal_of_the_US_Department_of_the_Army.svg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Army","/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Army","/wiki/United_States_Cabinet","/wiki/United_States_Army","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Navy","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Air_Force","/wiki/Secretary_of_War","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Army","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Air_Force","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Navy","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense","#History","#1790-1800","#1800.E2.80.931860","#Civil_War_to_1898","#1898.E2.80.931939","#World_War_I","#World_War_II","#Postwar","#Office_space","#Organization","#The_seal_of_the_department","#See_also","#Footnotes","#Further_reading","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/George_Washington","/wiki/United_States_Congress","/wiki/Commander_in_chief","/wiki/Secretary_of_war","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Henry_Knox","/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/Fort_Cumberland_(Maryland)","/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion","/wiki/George_Washington","/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton","/wiki/John_Adams","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&veaction=edit&section=3","/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy","/wiki/War_of_1812","/wiki/John_C._Calhoun","/wiki/Winfield_Scott","/wiki/American_Civil_War","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Bureau_of_Indian_Affairs","/wiki/Department_of_the_Interior","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&veaction=edit&section=4","/wiki/Union_Army","/wiki/Bureau_of_Refugees,_Freedmen_and_Abandoned_Lands","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&veaction=edit&section=5","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Spanish-American_War","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Elihu_Root","/wiki/Nelson_A._Miles","/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy","/wiki/West_Point,_New_York","/wiki/United_States_Army_War_College","/wiki/Staff_(military)","/wiki/Spanish-American_War","/wiki/William_Howard_Taft","/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt","/wiki/Henry_L._Stimson","/wiki/Leonard_Wood","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&veaction=edit&section=6","/wiki/National_Defense_Act_of_1916","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson","/wiki/Newton_D._Baker","/wiki/Benedict_Crowell","/wiki/George_W._Goethals","/wiki/Peyton_C._March","/wiki/John_J._Pershing","/wiki/American_Expeditionary_Forces","/wiki/George_C._Marshall","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&action=edit&section=7","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_War&veaction=edit&
