He served with the British Army as a Laboratory Assistant at\nSt George's Hospital from 1917 to 1919.\n\nElecting to study chemistry, Quastel received a baccalaureate from Imperial\nCollege London in 1921. Pursuing graduate work at the University of Cambridge,\nQuastel studied with Frederick Gowland Hopkins, the leading figure in British\nbiochemistry and a future Nobel Prize recipient for his work on the nutritional\nimportance of vitamins. Under Hopkins, Quastel received a Doctor of Philosophy\ndegree from the University of Cambridge in biochemistry in 1924 and, not long\nafter, was made a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nQuastel remained in Hopkinsâ department as a demonstrator and lecturer from 1923\nto 1929, during which he pioneered the research of microbial enzymology. He\nobtained a doctorate of science from Cambridge in 1926 and received a Beit\nMemorial Fellowship in 1928.\n\nQuastel accepted a position as Director of Research at the Cardiff City Mental\nHospital in 1930. From this location, he was able to conduct early work on the\nenzymology and metabolism of the brain. For these studies, Quastel was made a\nFellow of the Royal Society of London in 1940.\n\nIn 1941, when Britain's wartime food supply emerged as a strategic concern,\nthe Agricultural Research Council (ARC) asked Quastel to lead a new research\nunit focused on improving crop yield at the Rothamsted Experimental Station.\nBy analyzing soil as a dynamic system, rather than an inert substance, he was\nable to apply techniques such as perfusion, with which he had become familiar\nin studies of animal organs. On this approach, Quastel later wrote (1946)\nthat \"soil as a whole can be considered an organ comparable in some respects\nto a liver or a gland to which may be added various nutrients, pure or\ncomplex degraded plant materials, rain, air, and in which enzymatic reactions\ncan occur.\"\n\nUsing these techniques, Quastel was able to quantify the influence of various\nplant hormones, inhibitors and other chemicals on the activity of microorganisms\nin the soil and assess their direct impact on plant growth. While the full work\nof the unit remained secret, certain discoveries were developed for commercial\nuse after the war. Best known is the compound commonly labeled as 2,4-D, one of\nthe first systemic or hormone herbicides, a class of chemicals responsible for\ntriggering a worldwide revolution in agricultural output and still the most\nwidely used weed-killer in the world. Another invention was developed as a soil\nconditioner and is marketed by Monsanto Company under the trade name\nKrilium.\n\nAfter World War II, Quastel was invited to become Assistant Director of the\nnewly founded McGill University-Montreal General Hospital Research Institute and\nprofessor of biochemistry at McGill University, and, in 1947, he accepted the\ninvitation. The following year, he was appointed Director of the Institute.\n\nDuring his nineteen years at McGill University, Quastel supervised seventy Ph.D.\ncandidates and his Institute published over three hundred scientific papers on\ntopics including metabolism of micro-organisms, soil biochemistry,\nneurobiochemistry, neurotropic drugs, anaesthesia, cancer biochemistry, enzyme\ninhibition, and transport of nutrients and ions across membranes. Once he\nreached McGillâs retirement age in 1966, Quastel accepted a professorship of\nneurochemistry at the University of British Columbia in the Department of\nPsychiatry, the first such position for that institution.\n\nQuastel received many honors, including, in 1970, Canada's highest recognition,\nthe Companionship of the Order of Canada. In the same year, he received an\nhonorary doctorate from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, of which he had also\nbeen a governor since 1950. He received an honorary Doctorate of Science from\nMcGill University in 1969. He was made an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society\nof Edinburgh in 1983.\n\nQuastel had three childrenâMichael, David and Barbaraâwith his first wife,\nHenrietta Quastel, who died in 1973. He died in 1987 in Vancouver, survived by\nhis second wife, Susan Ricardo, and eleven grandchildren.\n","linknr":179,"url":"Judah_Hirsch_Quastel","recorded":1376425096,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Juda_Hirsch_Quastel&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Juda_Hirsch_Quastel&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juda_Hirsch_Quastel","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Judah_Hirsch_Quastel&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Order_of_Canada","/wiki/Companion_of_the_Order_of_Canada","/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Canada","/wiki/Royal_Society","/wiki/Neurochemistry","/wiki/Metabolism","/wiki/Cancer","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Sheffield","/wiki/Yorkshire","/wiki/England","/wiki/St_George%27s_Hospital","/wiki/Imperial_College_London","/wiki/University_of_Cambridge","/wiki/Frederick_Gowland_Hopkins","/wiki/Nobel_Prize","/wiki/Vitamin","/wiki/Frederick_Gowland_Hopkins","/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy","/wiki/University_of_Cambridge","/wiki/Biochemistry","/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge","/wiki/Cardiff","/wiki/Royal_Society_of_London","#cite_note-frs-4","/wiki/Agricultural_and_Food_Research_Council","/wiki/Rothamsted_Experimental_Station","/wiki/Perfusion","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/2,4-D","/wiki/Herbicides","/wiki/Monsanto_Company","#cite_note-5","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/McGill_University","/wiki/McGill_University","/wiki/McGill_University","/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia","/wiki/Order_of_Canada","/wiki/Hebrew_University","/wiki/McGill_University","/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Edinburgh","/wiki/Vancouver","/w/index.php?title=Juda_Hirsch_Quastel&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Juda_Hirsch_Quastel&veaction=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1252172","/wiki/PubMed_Central","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1252172","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16744066","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Cite_pmid/16744066&action=edit&editintro=Template:Cite_pmid/editintro2","#cite_ref-2","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1263240","/wiki/PubMed_Central","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1263240","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16746209","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Cite_pmid/16746209&action=edit&editintro=Template:Cite_pmid/editintro2","#cite_ref-3","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1266739","/wiki/PubMed_Central","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1266739","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16745891","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Cite_pmid/16745891&action=edit&editintro=Template:Cite_pmid/editintro2","#cite_ref-frs_4-0","/wiki/Biographical_Memoirs_of_Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1098%2Frsbm.1990.0037","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Cite_doi/10.1098.2Frsbm.1990.0037&action=edit&editintro=Template:Cite_doi/editintro2","#cite_ref-5","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.115.2989.3","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17741863","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Cite_doi/10.1126.2Fscience.115.2989.3&action=edit&editintro=Template:Cite_doi/editintro2","/w/index.php?title=Juda_Hirsch_Quastel&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Juda_Hirsch_Quastel&veaction=edit&section=2","http://www5.open.ac.uk/Arts/chemists/person.cfm?SearchID=9975","http://www.library.ubc.ca/archives/pdfs/ubcreports/UBC_Reports_1987_10_22.pdf","http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqSearch=RefNo=='EC/1940/18'&dsqDb=Catalog","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/195019434","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Juda_Hirsch_Quastel&oldid=533197235","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:1899_births","/wiki/Category:1987_deaths","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Imperial_College_London","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Trinity_College,_Cambridge","/wiki/Catego
