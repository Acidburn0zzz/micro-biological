The word\npulmonary refers to the lungs. The word ''toilet'' is related to the French\ntoilette, refers to body care and hygiene; this root is used in words such as\n[[toiletry]] that also relate to cleansing. These methods are widely used by\nPhysiotherapists/specialist Physiotherapists who are specialising in\nCardiopulmonary field.\n\nRespiratory health (pulmonary hygiene) depends on consistent clearance of airway\nsecretions. Normal airway clearance is accomplished by 2 important mechanisms:\nthe mucociliary clearance system and the ability to cough. Impaired mucociliary\nclearance is linked to poor lung function in a broad range of diseases and\ndisabilities.\n\nPulmonary hygiene prevents atelectasis (the collapse of the alveoli of the\nlungs) and rids the respiratory system of secretions,\nwhich could cause respiratory infections. It can also decrease pulmonary\nshunting, increase the functional reserve capacity of the lungs, and prevent\nrespiratory infection after chest trauma. Methods\ninclude using suction to remove fluids and placing the patient in a position\nthat allows secretions to drain by gravity.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"pulmonary_toilet","recorded":1376428554,"links":[],"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Respiratory system procedures","Respiratory therapy"],"headings":["Methods","Applications","Indications","Contraindications","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["suction","medicine"]],"members":["suction"],"related":["Mucus","Secretion","Airway","Lung","Hygiene","Atelectasis","Alveoli","Respiratory_infection","Pulmonary_shunt","Functional_reserve_capacity","Chest_trauma","Suction_(medicine)","Chest_physiotherapy","Blow_bottle","Bronchoscopy","Spirometry","Analgesic","Coughing","Sedation","Tracheotomy","Cilia","Prone_position","Atelectasis","Bronchiectasis","Abscess","Vertebrate_trachea","Dorland's_Medical_Dictionary","Physiotherapy","Pneumonia","Cystic_fibrosis","Lung_disease","Lung_abscess","Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome","COPD","Pneumonia","Cystic_fibrosis","Hemoptysis","Pulmonary_embolism","Congestive_heart_failure","Respiratory_therapy","Chest_physiotherapy","ThAIRapy_Vest","Intrapulmonary_percussive_ventilator"]}
