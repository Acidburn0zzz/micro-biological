{"cursor":"1083","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Naked DNA' is histone-free DNA that is passed from cell to cell during a gene\ntransfer process called transformation or transfection. In transformation,\npurified or naked DNA is taken up by the recipient cell which will give the\nrecipient cell a new characteristic or phenotype. Transfection differs from\ntransformation since the DNA is not generally incorporated into the cell's\ngenome, it is only transiently expressed.\n\nIn the field of DNA vaccines or genetic immunization, the term \"naked DNA\" was\ncoined by Vical to mean DNA delivered free from agents which promote\ntransfection. Research on the use of naked DNA for DNA vaccinations and gene\ntherapy has shown some initial success, but have not yet resulted in any\ngenerally available therapy.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"naked_DNA","recorded":1376428977,"links":[],"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["DNA"],"headings":["External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["transformation","genetics"]],"members":["transformation"],"related":["Histone","DNA","Transformation_(genetics)","Transfection","Phenotype","DNA_vaccination","Gene_therapy"]}
