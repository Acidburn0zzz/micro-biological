Kitching,\nR.l., ed. The Ecology of Exotic Animals. Milton: John Wiley and Sons, 1986. 7-\n25. Currently, known populations of wild mosquitofish occur in every state\nand territory except the Northern Territory, and they are found in swamps,\nlakes, billabongs, thermal springs, salt lakes, and ornamental ponds.\nMosquitofish are considered a noxious pest, especially in New South Wales and\nQueensland, and it is illegal to release them into the wild or transport them\nlive into any of the states or territories. Fairfax, R, R Fensham, R Wager,\nS Brooks, A Webb, and P Unmack. 'Recovery of the Red-Finned Blue-Eye: an\nEndangered Fish From Springs of the Great Artesian Basin.' Wildlife Research 34\n(2007): 156-166. 14 May 2008 .\nMosquitofish were introduced by military and local councils to control mosquito\npopulations, however there has been no evidence that gambusia has had any effect\nin controlling mosquito populations or mosquito-borne diseases. Lake, John\nS. Freshwater Fishes and Rivers of Australia. Thomas Nelson and Sons, Ltd.\nSydney: 1971. 26. In fact, studies have shown that gambusia can suffer\nmortalities if fed only on mosquito larvae, and survivors show poor growth and\nmaturation. Gambusia typically eat zooplankton, beetles,\nmayflies, caddis flies, mites and other invertebrates; mosquito larvae make up\nonly a small portion of their diet. Lund, Mark. 'Mosquitofish: Friend or\nFoe?' Edith Cowan University. 16 November 2005. Dr. Mark Lund's Wetlands\nResearch Website, ECU. 9 May 2008 .\n\nMany ichthyologists believe native species are more effective in population\ncontrol than mosquitofish. Pollard, Jack, ed. G.P. Whitley's\nHandbook of Australian Fishes. Sydney: Jack Pollard, Ltd., 1980. 489.\nThese include species such as the western minnow and pygmy perches. 'Fish\nare Best for Mosquito and Tadpole Control in Marron Ponds.' Government of\nWestern Australia. September 1998. Department of Fisheries. 9 May 2008\n. Unfortunately,\ngambusia may have exacerbated the mosquito problem in many areas by outcompeting\nnative invertebrate predators of mosquito larvae. Because of their aggressive\nnature and high birthrate, mosquitofish can overtake most native species in an\narea, drastically harming local populations. Even if they were needed for\nmosquito control, studies have also shown that at least 5,000 fish/ha would be\nneeded for effective control. However, mosquitoes' breeding environments are\nmigratory and unreliable, so regular fish predators can have little effect from\nyear to year.\n\nMosquitofish have a high tolerance for salinity, low oxygen, extreme\ntemperatures (from 0.5-35Â°C), and pollutants, and are therefore able to live in\nmany areas where other fish cannot. Certain thermal adaptations have allowed\nthem to live in places from 55Â° North to 44Â° South, expanding their natural\nrange. They have a resistance to a wide variety of\npollutants, including organic waste, heavy metals, insecticides, herbicides,\nrotenone, phenol, and radiation. Ichthyologists believe\nthe reason for low mosquito levels in areas populated by gambusia is not because\nof the fish, but rather the insecticide in the water killing the larvae.\n\nMosquitofish have harmed native fish populations in many ways. By consuming algae-\neating zooplankton, they increase the chances of algae blooms in the water,\nreducing the water quality. They are very aggressive, and tend to attack other\nfish and nip their fins, leading to infection or death. Moore, Anthony S.\n'Density Dependent Interference Competition Between Gambusia holbrooki and Three\nAustralian Native Fish.' Australian Society for Fish Biology (2002). 9 May 2008\n. Studies have\nshown that the purple spotted gudgeon fish population has declined as a result\nof high densities of mosquitofish. McDowall, R.m., ed. Freshwater Fishes of\nSouth-Eastern Australia. Wellington: Reed Pty, Ltd., 1980. 94. They have\nalso negatively impacted populations of beetles, backswimmers, rotifers, red\nfinned blue eye, Edgbast goby, crustaceans and mollusks, to name a few. 'Gambusia Control Homepage.' Gambusia.Net. 9 May 2008\n. In a study done by Keane et al., 2004, one major\nthreat to Tasmanian fauna could be to native galaxiids, as suggested by the fact\nthat mosquitofish are known to attack and kill adult [[dwarf inanga|Galaxias\ngracilis]] in New Zealand. Keane, John P. and Francisco J.\nNeira. 'First Record of Mosquitofish, Gambusia Holbrooki, in Tasmania,\nAustralia: Stock Structure and Reproductive Biology.' New Zealand Journal of\nMarine and Freshwater Research 38 (2004): 857-867. If gambusia became\nnative in certain areas by eradicating other fish populations, it could put a\ngreat deal of stress on the remaining flora and fauna. Decreasing the number of\nnative species would also benefit mosquitoes by decreasing the competitive\npressure from other fish. Because of their high reproductive rate (an average of\n50 young per brood, with up to nine broods per year), fast maturation (sexual\nmaturity is reached in two months), and aggressive behaviour, mosquitofish can\noutcompete almost any native fish.\n\nMosquitofish also pose a threat to populations of native frogs (such as\nLimnodynastes ornatus) in natural water bodies where these species co-occur. In\none study conducted by Keane et al., gambusia consumed the tadpoles of L.\nornastus, leading researchers to believe that over a period of time, they could\nwipe out the L. ornastus population as a whole. Gambusia are known predators of\ntadpoles of other closely related frog species, such as L. aurea and L. dentate.\nThe green and golden bellfrog in Tasmania is now directly threatened by\ngambusia, and is listed on Tasmaniaâs Threatened Species Protection Act of\n1995. Another study conducted by Keane found that tadpoles\nare better suited to environments without introduced fish. Responses observed in\nthe green and golden bellfrog suggest that tadpoles are naÃ¯ve to mosquitofish\nbecause they did not respond to them. Additionally, gambusia and other\nintroduced fish may have reduced the suitability of permanent water bodies as\nbreeding sites for pond-breeding amphibian species such as the green and golden\nbellfrog. Hamer, A, S Lane, and M Mahony. 'The Role of Introduced\nMosquitofish in Excluding the Native Green and Golden Bell Frog From Original\nHabitats in South-Eastern Australia.' Oecologia 132 (2002): 445-452. 9 May 2008\n.\n\nOne species of fish, the Edgbaston hardyhead, is restricted to one spring-fed\npool in the Edgbaston Spring Complex located in Edgbaston Station, central\nQueensland. The hardyhead competes with the mosquitofish for food and resources;\nif the mosquitofish outcompetes the hardyhead, they will have eradicated an\nentire species in one fell swoop. That is why the hardyhead is now considered a\nhigh priority for conservation recovery actions in Queensland, where steps are\nnow being taken to exterminate the mosquitofish from the spring. 'Edgbaston\nGoby.' Nature Conservancy and Wildlife. 21 August 2007. Queensland Government.\n14 May 2008 .\n\nThe mosquitofish was nominated as an environmental hazard under the NSW\nThreatened Species Conservation Act in 1999, making it illegal for landowners to\ndo anything that would help spread gambusia. McKew, Maxine. 'Scientists\nDeclare War on Mosquitofish.' ABC News. 14 April 1999. ABC News Online. 9 May\n2008 .  This includes\nreleasing mosquitofish pets into the wild, one of the biggest problems affecting\nlocal rivers throughout eastern Australia. Proposals for gambusia population\ncontrol have included introducing viral, bacterial, or fungal diseases and\nparasites into an overpopulated area. However, many diseases can jump species\nand would harm native fish. The Tasmanian\ngovernment has taken steps to eradicate mosquitofish by containing current\npopulations and minimizing paths of dispersal. In Gordonâs\nLagoon at the Clarkesdale Bird Sanctuary in Linton, Victoria, which experiences\nmajor infestations of mosquitofish year-round, park managers have taken\nadvantage of recent dry conditions by draining ponds. Residual wet areas are\ntreated with lime solutions, changing the pH of the water and killing off the\nfish. Komak, Spogmai, and Michael R. Crossland. 'An Assessment of the\nIntroduced Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis holbrooki) as a Predator of Eggs,\nHatchlings and Tadpoles of Native and Non-Native Anurans.' Wildlife Research\n(2000): 185-189. 10 May 2008\n. Other ideas have\nbeen proposed, but attempting to isolate them to affect only the mosquitofish is\nstill unrealistic. Gambusia also thrive due to their habits of consuming faecal\nmatter and general organic waste.\n","linknr":162,"url":"Mosquitofish_in_Australia","recorded":1376420691,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Mosquitofish_in_Australia&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mosquitofish_in_Australia&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquitofish_in_Australia","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Gambusia_affinis_01.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Gambusia_affinis_01.jpg/220px-Gambusia_affinis_01.jpg","/wiki/File:Gambusia_affinis_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Mosquitofish_Victoria_Park_pond.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Mosquitofish_Victoria_Park_pond.jpg/220px-Mosquitofish_Victoria_Park_pond.jpg","/wiki/File:Mosquitofish_Victoria_Park_pond.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Victoria_Park,_Sydney","/wiki/Mosquitofish","/wiki/Australia","#cite_note-kitching-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-kitching-1","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Ichthyology","#cite_note-whitley-5","/wiki/Western_minnow","/w/index.php?title=Pygmy_perch&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-kitching-1","/wiki/55th_parallel_north","/wiki/44th_parallel_south","#cite_note-kitching-1","#cite_note-kitching-1","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Backswimmer","/wiki/Rotifer","/w/index.php?title=Red_finned_blue_eye&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Edgbast_goby&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Crustacean","/wiki/Mollusk","#cite_note-GambusiaControl-9","/wiki/Dwarf_inanga","#cite_note-keane-10","#cite_note-whitley-5","#cite_note-keane-10","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-13","#cite_note-GambusiaControl-9","#cite_note-keane-10","/wiki/Clarkesdale_Bird_Sanctuary","/wiki/Linton,_Victoria","#cite_note-14","/w/index.php?title=Mosquitofish_in_Australia&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Mosquitofish_in_Australia&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Invasive_species_in_Australia","/wiki/Conservation_in_Australia","/wiki/Environmental_issues_in_Australia","/wiki/Gambusia_affinis","/wiki/Gambusia_holbrooki","/w/index.php?title=Mosquitofish_in_Australia&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Mosquitofish_in_Australia&veaction=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-kitching_1-0","#cite_ref-kitching_1-1","#cite_ref-kitching_1-2","#cite_ref-kitching_1-3","#cite_ref-kitching_1-4","#cite_ref-2","http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=WR06086","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","http://www.ecu.edu.au/chs/cem/research/wetlands_research/exotic/ghfoe.html","#cite_ref-whitley_5-0","#cite_ref-whitley_5-1","#cite_ref-6","http://www.fish.wa.gov.au/docs/aq/aq019/index.php?0404","#cite_ref-7","http://asfb.org.au/pubs/2002/asfb_2002-45.htm#TopOfPage","#cite_ref-8","#cite_ref-GambusiaControl_9-0","#cite_ref-GambusiaControl_9-1","http://gambusia.net","#cite_ref-keane_10-0","#cite_ref-keane_10-1","#cite_ref-keane_10-2","#cite_ref-11","http://www.springerlink.com/content/nxwqmlg1hgn78hfc/","#cite_ref-12","http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/nature_conservation/wildlife/native_animals/edgbaston_goby/","#cite_ref-13","http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s21851.htm","#cite_ref-14","http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/144/paper/WR99028.htm","/w/index.php?title=Mosquitofish_in_Australia&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Mosquitofish_in_Australia&veaction=edit&section=3","http://www.gambusia.net","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mosquitofish_in_Australia&oldid=534333538","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Invasive_animal_species_in_Australia","/wiki/Category:Gambusia","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mosquitofish+in+Australia&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mosquitofish+in+Australia","/wiki/Mosquitofish_in_Australia","/wiki/Talk:Mosquitofish_in_Australia","#","/wiki/Mosquitofish_in_Australia","/w/index.php?title=Mosquitofish_in_Australia&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mosquitofish_in_Australia&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mosquitofish_in_Aust
