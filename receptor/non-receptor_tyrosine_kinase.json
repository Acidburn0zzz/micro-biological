Non-\nreceptor tyrosine kinases are a subgroup of protein family tyrosine kinases,\nenzymes that can transfer the phosphate group from ATP to a protein\n(phosphorylation). These enzymes regulate many cellular functions by switching\non or switching off other enzymes in a cell.\n\nUnlike the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the second subgroup of tyrosine\nkinases, the non-receptor tyrosine kinases are cytoplasmic enzymes. There was\nfound 32 non-receptor tyrosine kinases in a human cells (). Non-receptor\ntyrosine kinases regulate for example cell's growth, proliferation,\ndifferentiation, adhesion, migration and apoptosis and they are critical\ncomponents in the regulation of the immune system.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"non-receptor_tyrosine_kinase","recorded":1376428380,"links":[],"instances":["gene","gene","gene","gene","gene","gene","gene","gene","gene"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 2.7.10","Enzymes of known structure"],"headings":["Function","Structure","Regulation","Inhibitors","Examples","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["src","gene"],["src","gene"],["abl","gene"],["fer","gene"],["srms","gene"],["src","gene"],["fgr","gene"],["tec","gene"],["tec","gene"],["bmx","gene"],["itk","gene"],["txk","gene"]],"members":["fer","fgr","itk","src","bmx","tec","txk","srms","abl"],"related":["Cytoplasmic","Enzyme","Phosphate","Nucleoside_triphosphate","Adenosine_triphosphate","Protein","Tyrosine_kinase","Receptor_tyrosine_kinases","Apoptosis","Immune_system","Signal_transduction","T-cell","B-cell","T-cell_receptor","B-cell_receptor","IL-2_receptor","Erythropoietin_receptor","Prolactin_receptor","CD4","CD8","T_lymphocyte","Src_(gene)","Lck","Zap70","Cytokine","LYN","Syk","Bruton's_tyrosine_kinase","Agammaglobulinemia","Transmembrane","N-terminus","SH2_domain","SH3_domain","Janus_kinase","Focal_adhesion","Src_(gene)","Myristoylation","Carboxy-terminal","C-src_tyrosine_kinase","Rous_sarcoma_virus","ABL_(gene)","Immunoreceptor_tyrosine-based_activation_motif","Zap70","Janus_kinase","Tyrosine_kinase_2","Jak2","SOCS","Metastasis","Neovascularization","Monoclonal_antibodies","Tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor","Abl_gene","Abl_gene","Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia","Chromosomal_translocation","BCR_gene","Gene","Fusion_gene","Cytokines","Cancerous","ABL2","TNK2","TNK2","TNK1","C-src_tyrosine_kinase","C-src_tyrosine_kinase","Megakaryocyte-associated_tyrosine_kinase","PTK2","PTK2","PTK2B","Feline_sarcoma_oncogene","Feline_sarcoma_oncogene","FER_(gene)","Fyn-related_kinase","Fyn-related_kinase","PTK6","SRMS_(gene)","Janus_kinase","Janus_kinase_1","Janus_kinase_2","Janus_kinase_3","Tyrosine_kinase_2","SRC","Src_(gene)","FGR_(gene)","FYN","YES1","Tyrosine-protein_kinase_BLK","HCK","Lck","LYN","TEC_(gene)","TEC_(gene)","BMX_(gene)","Bruton's_tyrosine_kinase","ITK_(gene)","TXK_(gene)","Syk","Syk","ZAP-70"]}
