The Andalusian has been recognized as an\nindividual breed since the 15th century, and its conformation has changed very\nlittle over the centuries. Throughout its history, it has been known for its\nprowess as a war horse, and was prized by the nobility. The breed was used as a\ntool of diplomacy by the Spanish government, and kings across Europe rode and\nowned Spanish horses. During the 19th century, warfare, disease and\ncrossbreeding reduced herd numbers dramatically, and despite some recovery in\nthe late 19th century, the trend continued into the early 20th century.\nExports of Andalusians from Spain were restricted until the 1960s, but the breed\nhas since spread throughout the world, despite still-low population numbers. In\n2010, there were more than 185,000 registered Andalusians worldwide.\n\nStrongly built, and compact yet elegant, Andalusians have long, thick manes and\ntails. Their most common coat color is gray, although they can be found in many\nother colors. They are known for their intelligence, sensitivity and docility. A\nsub-strain within the breed known as the Carthusian, is considered by breeders\nto be the purest strain of Andalusian, though there is no genetic evidence for\nthis claim. The strain is still considered separate from the main breed however,\nand is preferred by breeders because buyers pay more for horses of Carthusian\nbloodlines. There are several competing registries keeping records of horses\ndesignated as Andalusian or PRE, but they differ on their definition of the\nAndalusian and PRE, the purity of various strains of the breed, and the\nlegalities of stud book ownership. At least one lawsuit is in progress , to\ndetermine the ownership of the Spanish PRE stud book.\n\nThe Andalusian is closely related to the Lusitano of Portugal, and has been used\nto develop many other breeds, especially in Europe and the Americas. Breeds with\nAndalusian ancestry include many of the warmbloods in Europe as well as western\nhemisphere breeds such as the Azteca. Over its centuries of development, the\nAndalusian breed has been selected for athleticism and stamina. The horses were\noriginally used for classical dressage, driving, bullfighting, and as stock\nhorses. Modern Andalusians are used for many equestrian activities, including\ndressage, show jumping and driving. The breed is also used extensively in\nmovies, especially historical pictures and fantasy epics.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Andalusian_horse","recorded":1376418415,"links":[],"instances":["horse","animal","horse","mascot","horse","horse","horse","horse","anatomy","horse","horse","horse_gait","horse","medicine","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","coat"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Andalusia","Horse breeds","Horse breeds originating in Spain"],"headings":["Characteristics","History","Naming and registration","Uses","Footnotes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["gray","horse"],["azteca","horse"],["driving","horse"],["stallion","horse"],["mare","horse"],["rump","animal"],["feathering","horse"],["temple","anatomy"],["gray","horse"],["bay","horse"],["black","horse"],["chestnut","coat"],["buckskin","horse"],["hair_whorl","horse"],["collection","horse"],["trot","horse_gait"],["complication","medicine"],["barb","horse"],["colt","horse"],["barb","horse"],["hanoverian","horse"],["holstein","horse"],["east_friesian","horse"],["gelderland","horse"],["azteca","horse"],["criollo","horse"],["driving","horse"],["traveler","mascot"]],"members":["barb","rump","driving","traveler","collection","mare","criollo","stallion","temple","azteca","bay","trot","buckskin","complication","east_friesian","colt","gelderland","hair_whorl","black","hanoverian","gray","feathering","holstein","chestnut"],"related":["Horse_breed","Iberian_Peninsula","Equine_conformation","Horses_in_warfare","Crossbreed","Equine_coat_color","Gray_(horse)","Breed_registry","Breed_registry","Lusitano","List_of_horse_breeds","Warmblood","Western_hemisphere","Azteca_(horse)","Classical_dressage","Driving_(horse)","Bullfighting","Stock_horse","Equestrianism","Dressage","Show_jumping","Stallion_(horse)","Gelding","Withers","Mare_(horse)","Withers","Rump_(animal)","Horse_gaits","Feathering_(horse)","Foundation_bloodstock","Calcium","Temple_(anatomy)","Equine_coat_color","Gray_(horse)","Bay_(horse)","Black_(horse)","Dun_gene","Palomino","Chestnut_(coat)","Buckskin_(horse)","Perlino","Cremello","Horse_markings","Hair_whorl_(horse)","Collection_(horse)","Kinematic","Anglo-Arabian","Trot_(horse_gait)","Horse_gaits","Ischaemic","Small_intestine","Stallions","Inguinal_hernia","Large_intestine","Laminitis","Complication_(medicine)","Iberian_horse","Andalusia","Iberian_Peninsula","Sorraia","Mitochondrial_DNA","Genetic_cluster","Celts","Carthaginians","Ancient_Rome","Germanic_tribes","Moors","Horses_in_warfare","Mitochondrial_DNA","Iberian_peninsula","Barb_(horse)","North_Africa","Strait_of_Gibraltar","Oriental_horse","Pedigree_chart","Carthusian","Monastic","Stud_farm","Jerez_de_la_Frontera","Seville","Cazalla_de_la_Sierra","Crown_of_Castile","Jennet","Foundation_bloodstock","Warmblood","Cavalry","William_Cavendish,_1st_Duke_of_Newcastle-upon-Tyne","Duke_of_Newcastle","Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor","Philip_II_of_Spain","Francis_I_of_France","Louis_XVI","Portrait","Louis_XIII","Louis_XIV","Henri_IV","Henry_VIII_of_England","Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon","Duke_of_Savoy","Katherine_of_Aragon","Malmesbury","Tutbury","Thoroughbred","Conquistador","Santo_Domingo","Moldovia","Transylvania","George_I_Rákóczi","Draft_horse","War_of_the_Oranges","Peninsular_War","Carlist_Wars","Napoleon","Anglo-Norman_horse","Arabian_horse","La_Cartuja","Neapolitan_horse","Chivalry","Thoroughbred","Warmblood","Draft_horse","Genetic_variability","Genetic_distance","Fixation_index","Stallion","Mare","Aranjuez","Colt_(horse)","Neapolitan_horse","Arabian_horse","Barb_(horse)","Peninsular_Wars","Stud_farm","Jerez_de_la_Frontera","Badajoz","Córdoba,_Spain","Stallion","Mare","Gelding","Habsburg","Crossbred","Low_Countries","Neapolitan_horse","Groningen_Horse","Lipizzaner","Kladruber","Hanoverian_(horse)","Holstein_(horse)","East_Friesian_(horse)","Oldenburg","Friesian_horse","Gelderland_(horse)","Frederiksborg_horse","Knabstrupper","Alter_Real","Lusitano","Azteca_(horse)","American_Quarter_Horse","Criollo_(horse)","Colonial_Spanish_Horse","Warlander","Spanish-Norman_horse","Percheron_horse","Andalusia","Lusitano","Jennet","Extremadura","Jaén,_Spain","Breed_registry","Australasia","Crossbred","Purebred","European_Union","Brussels","Stud_book","Driving_(horse)","Dressage","World_Equestrian_Games","2004_Summer_Olympics","Stock_horse","Bull_fighting","Show_jumping","Western_pleasure","Horse_show","Traveler_(mascot)","University_of_Southern_California","Stallion","Conquistador","Don_Juan_de_Oñate","El_Paso,_Texas"]}
