The phrase\n\"no hoof, no horse\" underlines how much the health and the strength of the hoof\nis crucial for horse soundness.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"horse_hoof","recorded":1376429062,"links":[],"instances":["equine","horse","foot","horse","horse"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Horse anatomy","Equine hoof|*","Farriery"],"headings":["Hooves in the natural state","Anatomy","Characters and functions of the external hoof structures","The hoof mechanism","Time-related changes of the hoof","Disorders","See also","External links","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["mustang","horse"],["frog","horse"],["sole","foot"],["lameness","equine"],["mustang","horse"],["thrush","horse"]],"members":["lameness","mustang","sole","thrush","frog"],"related":["Phalanx_bones","Pentadactyl_limb","Vertebrate","Equidae","Keratin","Mustang_(horse)","Iberian_horse","Spain","Natural_selection","Barefoot_movement","Horseshoe","Eventing","Pedal_bone","Rasp","Exoskeleton","Arthropod","Coffin_bone","Frog_(horse)","Periople","Sulcus","Sole_(foot)","Horse","Lameness_(equine)","Pedal_bone","Cartilagineous","Navicular_syndrome","Pastern","Navicular_bone","Mitosis","Complex_adaptive_system","Mustang_(horse)","Evolution_of_the_horse","Laminitis","Navicular_Disease","Thrush_(horse)","Quiltor","Draft_horse","Vertical_direction","Natural_hoof_care","Limbs_of_the_horse","Farrier","Evolution_of_the_horse","Horseshoe"]}
