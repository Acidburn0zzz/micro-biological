Ponder, himself, won the Derby in 1949. Pensive,\nPonder, and Needles are the second family of grandfather, father, and son to win\nthe Kentucky Derby (the first were Reigh Count in 1928, 1943 Triple Crown winner\nCount Fleet, and Count Turf in 1951).\n\nA Calumet Farm foal, trained by the Hall of Fame conditioner Ben Jones, Ponder\nwas a closer, meaning he liked to run his races from behind. Jones claimed if\nPonder had more often given himself more time to catch up, he would have won a\nlot more of his races. But those he did win, mattered.\n\nRunning in the same years as his stable mates Coaltown and Citation, both one\nyear older, as well as competing against the very good Greentree Stable's Capot\nwho took the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes the year he won the Derby,\nPonder lost all four of his two-year-old starts. On January 3, 1949 he broke his\nmaiden at Tropical Park. Winning two more races, Jones still thought of him as a\nlesser contender for Calumet's chances in the '49 Derby. Actually Ben Jones\nwasn't sure he had a Derby contender in 1949 and was vocal about it. His other\npossibility was a colt called De Luxe. But then Ponder ran in the Derby Trial.\nAlthough he was beaten by Olympia, it was only by a length and at the end Ponder\nwas rolling. He left Capot five lengths behind. Considering Olympia's record up\nto that point, a winner on both coasts and the fact that he was the odds-on\nfavorite to win the Derby itself, Jones was impressed.\n\nIn the Derby, Olympia led for the entire first mile with Capot right on his\nheels. Ridden by Hall of Fame jockey, Steve Brooks, Ponder was dead last. He\nwas twelfth after six furlongs and sixth as the field turned for home. And\nthen Ponder began to turn it on. His gain was described as \"relentless,\"\nsweeping past them all and winning the Derby by three lengths. Capot held on\nfor second, but Olympia had faded to sixth. Ponder had run the last quarter in\nabout :23 4/5ths.\n\nBack then, the Preakness Stakes was more suited to a speed horse with its tight\nturns and short home stretch. Capot was a front runner and the Preakness suited\nhim well. In the race, Ponder was gaining momentum but ran out of racing room.\nIn their next encounter, the Peter Pan Stakes, the turns were wider and when\nPonder got going from his usual slow start, he beat Capot by ten lengths. And\nthen came the Belmont Stakes. Ponder began it as he began the Kentucky Derby,\nbut by now Capot's jockey Ted Atkinson knew his rival. Instead of forcing the\npace, he kept it slow allowing Capot to have just enough left to withstand\nPonder's fast late charge.\n\nPonder lost his next two races, as did Capot. But on July 30, they met for the\nlast time in the Arlington Classic. Capot finished 14 lengths behind Ponder\nwhose late kick was perfect for the track. Next Ponder came in second to the\nolder Coaltown, both running a world record mile, and then he won the American\nDerby over Kentucky Colonel and John's Joy and came in a good third by a head\nand a neck in the Narragansett Special, with wins as well in the Lawrence\nRealization Stakes and the Jockey Club Gold Cup (ridden by Eddie Arcaro).\n\nBecause of his Belmont and Preakness victories, Capot edged out Ponder as\nAmerican Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse for 1949.\n\nIn California on February 11, 1950, in his four-year-old season, Ponder took the\nSan Antonio Handicap from the older Citation. Third was the Irish-bred Noor,\nanother \"come-from-behind\" runner, imported from the United Kingdom after modest\nsuccess. (In the United States, his star would rise.) In an overnight prep, he\nwas beaten by Your Host, but beat Hill Prince who came in third and who would\nwin 1950 American Horse of the Year honors.\n\nWhen he went to stud at Calumet, he produced Needles in his very first crop.\nPonder died in 1958.\n","linknr":287,"url":"Ponder_(horse)","recorded":1376427128,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ponder_(horse)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ponder_(horse)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponder_(horse)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Pensive","/wiki/Hyperion_(horse)","/w/index.php?title=Miss_Rushin&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Blenheim_II","/wiki/Stallion","/wiki/Calumet_Farm","/wiki/Calumet_Farm","/wiki/Ben_A._Jones","/wiki/Kentucky_Derby","/wiki/American_Derby","/wiki/Arlington_Classic","/wiki/Jockey_Club_Gold_Cup","/wiki/Lawrence_Realization_Stakes","/wiki/Peter_Pan_Stakes","/wiki/Santa_Anita_Maturity","/wiki/Arlington_Handicap","/wiki/San_Antonio_Handicap","/wiki/Tanforan_Racetrack","/w/index.php?title=Marchbank_Handicap&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Thoroughbred","/wiki/Racehorse","/wiki/Kentucky_Derby","/wiki/Pensive","/wiki/Needles_(horse)","/wiki/Calumet_Farm","/wiki/National_Museum_of_Racing_and_Hall_of_Fame","/wiki/Ben_A._Jones","/wiki/Coaltown","/wiki/Citation_(horse)","/wiki/Greentree_Stable","/wiki/Capot","/wiki/Preakness_Stakes","/wiki/Belmont_Stakes","/wiki/Colt_(horse)","/wiki/Derby_Trial_Stakes","/wiki/National_Museum_of_Racing_and_Hall_of_Fame","/wiki/Jockey","/wiki/Steve_Brooks_(jockey)","/wiki/Furlong","/wiki/Peter_Pan_Stakes","/wiki/Belmont_Stakes","/wiki/Jockey","/wiki/Ted_Atkinson","/wiki/Arlington_Classic","/wiki/Coaltown","/wiki/American_Derby","/wiki/Lawrence_Realization_Stakes","/wiki/Jockey_Club_Gold_Cup","/wiki/Eddie_Arcaro","/wiki/American_Champion_Three-Year-Old_Male_Horse","/wiki/California","/wiki/San_Antonio_Handicap","/wiki/Citation_(horse)","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Noor_(horse)","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Your_Host_(horse)","/wiki/Hill_Prince","/wiki/American_Horse_of_the_Year","/w/index.php?title=Ponder_(horse)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Ponder_(horse)&veaction=edit&section=1","http://www.pedigreequery.com/ponder","/w/index.php?title=Ponder_(horse)&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Ponder_(horse)&veaction=edit&section=2","http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7817652","/wiki/Find_a_Grave","/wiki/Template:Kentucky_Derby_Winners","/wiki/Template_talk:Kentucky_Derby_Winners","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Kentucky_Derby_Winners&action=edit","/wiki/Kentucky_Derby","/wiki/Aristides_(horse)","/wiki/Vagrant_(horse)","/wiki/Baden-Baden_(horse)","/wiki/Day_Star","/wiki/Lord_Murphy","/wiki/Fonso","/wiki/Hindoo_(horse)","/wiki/Apollo_(horse)","/wiki/Leonatus","/wiki/Buchanan_(horse)","/wiki/Joe_Cotton_(horse)","/wiki/Ben_Ali_(horse)","/wiki/Montrose_(horse)","/wiki/Macbeth_II","/wiki/Spokane_(horse)","/wiki/Riley_(horse)","/wiki/Kingman_(horse)","/wiki/Azra_(horse)","/wiki/Lookout_(horse)","/wiki/Chant_(horse)","/wiki/Halma_(horse)","/wiki/Ben_Brush","/wiki/Typhoon_II","/wiki/Plaudit","/wiki/Manuel_(horse)","/wiki/Lieut._Gibson","/wiki/His_Eminence_(horse)","/wiki/Alan-a-Dale_(horse)","/wiki/Judge_Himes","/wiki/Elwood_(horse)","/wiki/Agile_(horse)","/wiki/Sir_Huon","/wiki/Pink_Star","/wiki/Stone_Street_(horse)","/wiki/Wintergreen_(horse)","/wiki/Donau_(horse)","/wiki/Meridian_(horse)","/wiki/Worth_(horse)","/wiki/Donerail","/wiki/Old_Rosebud_(horse)","/wiki/Regret_(horse)","/wiki/George_Smith_(horse)","/wiki/Omar_Khayyam_(horse)","/wiki/Exterminator_(horse)","/wiki/Sir_Barton","/wiki/Paul_Jones_(horse)","/wiki/Behave_Yourself_(horse)","/wiki/Morvich","/wiki/Zev_(horse)","/wiki/Black_Gold_(horse)","/wiki/Flying_Ebony","/wiki/Bubbling_Over_(horse)","/wiki/Whiskery","/wiki/Reigh_Count","/wiki/Clyde_Van_Dusen_(horse)","/wiki/Gallant_Fox","/wiki/Twenty_Grand","/wiki/Burgoo_King","/wiki/Brokers_Tip","/wiki/Cavalcade_(horse)","/wiki/Omaha_(horse)","/wiki/Bold_Venture_(horse)","/wiki/War_Admiral","/wiki/Lawrin","/wiki/Johnstown_(horse)","/wiki/Gallahadion","/wiki/Whirlaway","/wiki/Shut_Out_(horse)","/wiki/Count_Fleet","/wiki/Pensive","/wiki/Hoop_Jr.","/wiki/Assault_(horse)","/wiki/Jet_Pilot","/wiki/Citation_(horse)","/wiki/Middleground","/wiki/Count_Turf","/wiki/Hill_Gail","/wiki/Dark_St
