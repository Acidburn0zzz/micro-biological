The American Quarter Horse is the most popular\nbreed in the United States today, and the American Quarter Horse Association is\nthe largest breed registry in the world, with more than 5 million American\nQuarter Horses registered.\n\nThe American Quarter Horse is well known both as a race horse and for its\nperformance in rodeos, horse shows and as a working ranch horse.
