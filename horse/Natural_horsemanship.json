{"cursor":"17255","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The Horse Whisperer}}\n\n\n'Natural horsemanship', colloquially known as 'horse whispering', is a\ncollective term for a variety of horse training techniques which have seen rapid\ngrowth in popularity since the 1980s.\nThe techniques vary in their precise tenets but generally share principles of\ndeveloping a rapport with horses, using communication\ntechniques derived from observation of free-roaming horses, and rejecting abusive training methods.\n\nNatural horsemanship practitioners have created an exclusionary social meme,\ndescribing the approach as being a radical departure from \"traditional\"\ntechniques, which are often portrayed as being based in the use of unnecessary\nforce. Users and practitioners tend to relate benefits in\nrelation to the quasi-scientific narrative of the ethology of horse behaviour,\nand to the idea of anthropomorphic partnership. High\nprofile practitioners of natural horsemanship such as Monty Roberts and Pat\nParelli market their methods and equipment extensively through books, television\nappearances, live shows and other media. The combination\nof social demarcation and high-profile marketing makes the natural horsemanship\nmovement somewhat controversial among the equestrian community, with criticism\nleveled at practitioners on a number of levels, notably that the techniques are\nnot \"new\" and are classical concepts that are simply renamed or repackaged in\norder to be able to sell products and merchandise.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Natural_horsemanship","recorded":1376429062,"links":[],"instances":["livestock","film"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Horse behavior","Horse training","Natural horsemanship"],"headings":["History","Nomenclature","Common theories","Efficacy","Criticism","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["the_horse_whisperer","film"],["poll","livestock"]],"members":["poll","the_horse_whisperer"],"related":["Horse_training","Feral_horse","Meme","Ethology","Anthropomorphism","Monty_Roberts","Parelli_Natural_Horsemanship","Equestrianism","Xenophon","Operant_conditioning","Classical_dressage","Antoine_de_Pluvinel","François_Robichon_de_La_Guérinière","Cowboy","Horse_breaking","Semi-feral","Pacific_Northwest","Rocky_Mountain","Tom_and_Bill_Dorrance","Great_Basin","Ray_Hunt","Buck_Brannaman","Spain","Classical_dressage","Ireland","Daniel_\"Horse-Whisperer\"_Sullivan","The_Horse_Whisperer_(film)","Mark_Rashid","Operant_conditioning","Negative_reinforcement","Whip","Lasso","Longeing","Round_pen","Halter","Bosal","Hackamore","Lead_rope","Bit_ring","Snaffle_bit","Rein","Mecate_rein","Riding_aids","Bitless_bridle","Poll_(livestock)","Classical_dressage","English_riding","Aversive","Domestication_of_the_horse","Horseman's_Word","Rarey_technique"]}
