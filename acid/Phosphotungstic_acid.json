It is normally present as a hydrate.\n'EPTA' is the name of ethanolic phosphotungstic acid, its alcohol solution used\nin biology. It has the appearance of small, colorless-grayish or slightly yellow-\ngreen crystals, with melting point 89 Â°C (24 H 2O hydrate). It is\nodorless and soluble in water (200 g/100 ml). It is not especially toxic, but is\na mild acidic irritant. The compound is known by a variety of different names\nand acronyms (see 'other names' section of infobox).\n\nIn these names the \"12\" or \"dodeca\" reflects the fact that the anion contains 12\ntungsten atoms. Some early workers who did not know the structure, such as Hsien\nWu, Contribution to the chemistry of phosphomolybdic acids,\nphosphotungstic acids and allied substances H Wu The Journal of Biological\nChemistry 43, 1, (1920), 189 called it phospho-24-tungstic acid,\nformulating it as 3H 2O.P 2O 5\n24WO 3.59H 2O,\n(P 2W 24 O80 H6 ).29H 2O, which\ncorrectly identifies the atomic ratios of P, W and O. This formula was still\nquoted in papers as late as 1970. On phosphotungstic\nstaining, I G Quintarelli, R Zito, J.A Cifonelli The Journal of Histochemistry\nand Cytochemistry 19, 11, (1971, 641\n\nPhosphotungstic acid is used in histology as a component for staining of cell\nspecimens, often together with haematoxylin as PTAH. It binds to fibrin,\ncollagen, and fibres of connective tissues, and replaces the anions of dyes from\nthese materials, selectively decoloring them.\n\nPhosphotungstic acid is electron dense, opaque for electrons. It is a common\nnegative stain for viruses, nerves, polysaccharides, and other biological tissue\nmaterials for imaging by a transmission electron microscope.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Phosphotungstic_acid","recorded":1376428379,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Tungsten compounds","Phosphates","Oxides","Staining","Electron microscopy stains","Coordination compounds","Heteropoly acids"],"headings":["Structure","Preparation and chemical properties","Uses","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["iron(ii_sulfate"]],"members":[],"related":["Heteropoly_acid","Ethanol","Hsien_Wu","Journal_of_Biological_Chemistry","Journal_of_Histochemistry_and_Cytochemistry","Histology","Staining","Haematoxylin","PTAH","Fibrin","Collagen","Connective_tissue","Electron","Negative_stain","Virus","Nerve","Polysaccharide","Transmission_electron_microscope","L’Actualité_Chimique","Keggin_structure","Sodium_tungstate","Phosphoric_acid","Hydrochloric_acid","Canadian_Journal_of_Chemistry","Polyoxometalate","Silicotungstic_acid","NMR","Ethanol","Uric_acid","Iron(II)_sulfate","Heteropolyacid","Journal_of_Catalysis_1995","Hammett_acidity_function","Superacid","Heteropolyacid","Homogeneous_catalysis","Heterogeneous_catalysis","Aluminium_oxide","Silicon_dioxide","Homogeneous_catalysis","Homogeneous_catalysis","Prins_reaction","Heterogeneous_catalysis","Methanol","Lake_pigment","Pararosaniline","Histology","PTAH","Negative_stain","Transmission_electron_microscope","PTAH","Amino_acid","Purine","Pyrimidine","Amine","Mordant","The_Histochemical_Journal","Negative_stain","Atomic_number","Gravimetric_analysis","Proton_exchange_membrane","Nafion","Phosphomolybdic_acid"]}
