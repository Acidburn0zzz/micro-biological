{"cursor":"5355","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] 'Periodic acid-Schiff' ('PAS') is a staining method used to detect\npolysaccharides such as glycogen, and mucosubstances such as glycoproteins,\nglycolipids and mucins in tissues. The reaction of periodic acid oxidizes the\nvicinal diols in these sugars, usually breaking up the bond between two adjacent\ncarbons not involved in the glycosidic linkage or ring closure in the ring of\nthe monosaccharide units that are parts of the long polysaccharides, and\ncreating a pair of aldehydes at the two free tips of each broken monosaccharide\nring. The oxidation condition has to be sufficiently regulated so as to not\noxidize the aldehydes further. These aldehydes then react with the Schiff\nreagent to give a purple-magenta color. A suitable basic stain is often used as\na counterstain.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Periodic_acid-Schiff","recorded":1376428369,"links":[],"instances":["histology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Staining"],"headings":["Uses","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["fixation","histology"]],"members":["fixation"],"related":["Staining","Polysaccharides","Glycogen","Glycoproteins","Glycolipids","Periodic_acid","Sugar","Aldehyde","Monosaccharide","Schiff_reagent","Counterstain","Carbohydrate","Glycogen","Glycoprotein","Proteoglycan","Connective_tissue","Mucus","Glycocalyx","Basal_lamina","Glycogen_storage_disease","Adenocarcinomas","Paget's_disease_of_the_breast","Alveolar_soft_part_sarcoma","Macrophage","Whipple's_disease","Alpha_1-antitrypsin_deficiency","Mycosis_fungoides","Sezary_syndrome","Erythroleukemia","Pulmonary_alveolar_proteinosis","Fungus","Infection","Grocott's_methenamine_silver_stain","Neuronal_ceroid_lipofuscinosis","PAS_diastase","Cellulose","Fixation_(histology)","Formaldehyde","Bouin_solution","Blood_film","Methanol","Glutaraldehyde","False_positive","Methyl_violet","Prussian_blue","Egyptian_Blue","Methyl_blue","Methylene_blue","New_methylene_blue","Han_Purple","Potassium_ferrocyanide","Potassium_ferricyanide","Gentian_violet","Eosin","Fluorescein","Carboxyfluorescein","Fluorescein_isothiocyanate","Fluorescein_amidite","Erythrosine","Rose_Bengal","DyLight_Fluor","Fluorescein_diacetate_hydrolysis","Laser_dye"]}
