{"cursor":"35305","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n, a typical metal, reacting with hydrochloric acid, a typical acid]] An 'acid'\n(from the Latin acidus/acÄre meaning sour [http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/acid Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: acid] ) is\na chemical substance whose aqueous solutions are characterized by a sour taste,\nthe ability to turn blue litmus red, and the ability to react with bases and\ncertain metals (like calcium) to form salts. Aqueous solutions of acids have a\npH of less than 7. A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher\nconcentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. Chemicals or substances having\nthe property of an acid are said to be 'acidic'.\n\nCommon examples of acids include hydrochloric acid (a solution of hydrogen\nchloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive\nenzymes), acetic acid (vinegar is a dilute solution of this liquid), sulfuric\nacid (used in car batteries), and tartaric acid (a solid used in baking). As\nthese examples show, acids can be solutions or pure substances, and can be\nderived from solids, liquids, or gases. Strong acids and some concentrated weak\nacids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid.\n\nThere are three common definitions for acids: the Arrhenius definition, the BrÃ¸nsted-\nLowry definition, and the Lewis definition. The Arrhenius definition defines\nacids as substances which increase the concentration of hydrogen ions\n(H +), or more accurately, hydronium ions\n(H 3O +), when dissolved in water. The BrÃ¸nsted-Lowry\ndefinition is an expansion: an acid is a substance which can act as a proton\ndonor. By this definition, any compound which can easily be deprotonated can be\nconsidered an acid. Examples include alcohols and amines which contain O-H or\nN-H fragments. A Lewis acid is a substance that can accept a pair of electrons\nto form a covalent bond. Examples of Lewis acids include all metal cations, and\nelectron-deficient molecules such as boron trifluoride and aluminium\ntrichloride.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"acidic","recorded":1376428385,"links":[],"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","unit","chemistry","metal","physiology","glassware","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Acids|","Acid-base
