Nirvana went\nthrough a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who\njoined the band in 1990.\n\nIn the late 1980s Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge\nscene, releasing its first album [[Bleach (album)|Bleach]] for the independent\nrecord label Sub Pop in 1989. The band eventually came to develop a sound that\nrelied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy\nchoruses. After signing to major label DGC Records, Nirvana found unexpected\nsuccess with \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", the first single from the band's second\nalbum [[Nevermind]] (1991). Nirvana's sudden success widely popularized\nalternative rock as a whole, and the band's frontman Cobain found himself\nreferred to in the media as the \"spokesman of a generation\", with Nirvana being\nconsidered the \"flagship band\" of Generation X.

Nirvana's third studio album, [[In Utero (album)|In Utero]] (1993),\nfeatured an abrasive, less-mainstream sound and challenged the group's audience.\nThe album did not match the sales figures of Nevermind but was still a critical\nand commercial success.\n\nNirvana's brief run ended following the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994, but\nvarious posthumous releases have been issued since, overseen by Novoselic,\nGrohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. Since its debut, the band has sold over\n25 million records in the United States alone, and over 80 million records\nworldwide.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Nirvana_(band)","recorded":1376424765,"links":[],"instances":["album","band","band","nirvana_song","film","band","band","producer","song"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nirvana (band)|","1987 establishments in Washington (state)","1994 disestablishments in Washington (state)","Alternative rock groups from Washington (state)","Brit Award winners","DGC Records artists","Grammy Award-winning artists","Grunge musical groups","Musical groups established in 1987","Musical groups disestablished in 1994","Musical quartets","Musical trios","Sub Pop artists"],"headings":["History","Musical style","Legacy","Band members","Discography","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["fecal_matter","band"],["fecal_matter","band"],["sliver","song"],["scream","band"],["andy_wallace","producer"],["lithium","nirvana_song"],["in_utero","album"],["germs","band"],["sound_city","film"],["gang_of_four","band"]],"members":["in_utero","fecal_matter","scream","lithium","sound_city","gang_of_four","germs","andy_wallace","sliver"],"related":["Krist_Novoselic","Kurt_Cobain","1992_MTV_Video_Music_Awards","Aberdeen,_Washington","Alternative_rock","Grunge","Sub_Pop","DGC_Records","Fecal_Matter_(band)","Foo_Fighters","Kurt_Cobain","Krist_Novoselic","Dave_Grohl","Aaron_Burckhard","Dale_Crover","Dave_Foster","Chad_Channing","Jason_Everman","Dan_Peters","Rock_music","Kurt_Cobain","Krist_Novoselic","Aberdeen,_Washington","Dave_Grohl","Seattle","Grunge","Independent_record_label","Sub_Pop","DGC_Records","Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit","Alternative_rock","Generation_X","Death_of_Kurt_Cobain","Courtney_Love","Melvins","Fecal_Matter_(band)","Aaron_Burckhard","Angry_Samoans","Tacoma,_Washington","Olympia,_Washington","Dale_Crover","San_Francisco","Dave_Foster","Chad_Channing","Independent_record_label","Sub_Pop","Jack_Endino","Mudhoney","Heavy_metal_music","Black_Sabbath","The_Smithereens","Black_metal","Celtic_Frost","Jason_Everman","College_radio","Steve_Fisk","Butch_Vig","Madison,_Wisconsin","Sliver_(song)","Dan_Peters","Sonic_Youth","Buzz_Osborne","Dave_Grohl","Hardcore_punk","Scream_(band)","Kim_Gordon","DGC_Records","Sound_City_Studios","Van_Nuys,_Los_Angeles","In_Bloom","On_a_Plain","Slayer","Andy_Wallace_(producer)","Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit","MTV","Michael_Jackson","Reading_Festival","BBC_Online","MTV_Video_Music_Awards","Rape_Me","Lithium_(Nirvana_song)","MTV_Video_Music_Award_for_Best_Alternative_Video","MTV_Video_Music_Award_for_Best_New_Artist","Recording_Industry_Association_of_America","Puss/Oh,_the_Guilt","The_Jesus_Lizard","Touch_and_Go_Records","Steve_Albini","Independent_music","Pachyderm_Studio","Cannon_Falls,_Minnesota","Heart-Shaped_Box","All_Apologies","R.E.M.","Scott_Litt","Billboard_200","Christopher_John_Farley","Heart-Shaped_Box","Anton_Corbjin","Visible_Human_Project","In_Utero_(album)","William_S._Burroughs","1994_MTV_Video_Music_Awards","Pat_Smear","Germs_(band)","Lori_Goldston","Cris_Kirkwood","Curt_Kirkwood","Meat_Puppets","Courtney_Love","Rohypnol","Heroin","BBC_News","Dave_Grohl","Pat_Smear","Grammy_Award","Grammy_Award_for_Best_Alternative_Music_Album","Limited_liability_corporation","You_Know_You're_Right","Virgin_Records","Pitchfork_Media","Paul_McCartney","Sound_City_(film)","Consequence_of_Sound","Safeco_Field","Out_There!_Tour","Seattle_Post-Intelligencer","Gang_of_Four_(band)","Scratch_Acid","Michael_Azerrad","Black_Sabbath","Aerosmith","Led_Zeppelin","Pixies","Everett_True","Recording_Industry_Association_of_America","Stephen_Thomas_Erlewine","MSNBC","Jon_Pareles","Generation_X","MSNBC","Kurt_Cobain","Krist_Novoselic","Dave_Grohl","Aaron_Burckhard","Dale_Crover","Dave_Foster","Chad_Channing","Jason_Everman","Dan_Peters","Pat_Smear","Lori_Goldston","Nirvana_discography","List_of_alternative_rock_artists","List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Nirvana","List_of_best-selling_music_artists","List_of_musicians_from_Seattle","List_of_Nirvana_concerts"]}
