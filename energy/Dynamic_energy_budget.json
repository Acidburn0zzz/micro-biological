{"cursor":"9413","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB)' theory aims to identify simple quantitative\nrules for the organization of metabolism of individual organisms that can be\nunderstood from basic first principles. The word \"dynamic\" refers to the life\ncycle perspective of the theory, where the budget changes dynamically over time.\n\nCornerstones of the theory are:\n* conservation of mass, energy and time,\n* relationships between surface area and volume\n* stoichiometric constraints on production\n* organisational uncoupling of metabolic modules\n* strong and weak homeostasis\n* substrate(s) from the environment is/are first converted to reserve(s) before\n  being used for further metabolism\n\nThey are essential to understand evolution of metabolic organisation since the\norigin of life.\n\nDEB theory delineates reserves, as separate from structure. Reserves are\nsynthesized from environmental substrates (food) for use by the metabolism for\nthe purpose of somatic maintenance (including protein turnover, maintenance of\nconcentration gradients across membranes, activity and other types of work),\ngrowth (increase of structural mass), maturity maintenance (installation of\nregulation systems, preparation for reproduction, maintenance of defense\nsystems, such as the immune system), maturation (increase of the state of\nmaturity) and reproduction. This organizational position of reserve creates a\nrather constant internal chemical environment, with only an indirect coupling\nwith the extra-organismal environment. Reserves as well as structure are taken\nto be generalised compounds, i.e. mixtures of a large number of compounds, which\ndo not change in composition. The latter requirement is called the strong\nhomeostasis assumption. Polymers (carbohydrates, proteins, ribosomal RNA) and\nlipids form the main bulk of reserves and of structure.\n\nSome reasons for including reserve are to give an explanation for: #the\nmetabolic memory; changes in food (substrate) availability affect production\n(growth or reproduction) with some delay. Growth continues for some time during\nstarvation; embryo development is fueled by reserves #the composition of biomass\ndepends on growth rate. With two components (reserves and structure) particular\nchanges in composition can be captured. More complex changes require several\nreserves, as is required for autotrophs. #the body size scaling of life history\nparameters. The specific respiration rate decreases with (maximum) body size\nbetween species because large bodied species have relatively more reserve. Many\nother life history parameters directly or indirectly relate to respiration.\n#the observed respiration patterns, which reflect the use of energy. Freshly\nlaid eggs hardly respire, but their respiratory rates increase during\ndevelopment while egg weight decreases. After hatching, however, the respiration\nrate further increases, while the weight now also increases #all mass fluxes are\nlinear combinations of assimilation, dissipation and growth. If reserves are\nomitted, there is not enough flexibility to capture product formation and\nexplain indirect calorimetry.\n\nThe standard model quantifies the metabolism of isomorphs with 1 reserve and 1\nstructure that feeds on one type of food with a constant composition. The rules\nfor the standard model for reproducing multicellulars, and modified for dividing\nunicellulars, are:\n","linknr":153,"url":"Dynamic_energy_budget","recorded":1376422783,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_energy_budget","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.visualEditor.viewPageTarget.noscript&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Metabolism","/wiki/Mass_balance","/wiki/Energy_balance_(biology)","/w/index.php?title=Time_balance&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Stoichiometric","/wiki/Modularity_(biology)","/wiki/Homeostasis","/wiki/Dynamic_reserve","/wiki/Maintenance_of_an_organism","/wiki/Individual_growth","/wiki/Maintenance_of_an_organism","/wiki/Immune_system","/wiki/Developmental_biology","/wiki/Reproduction","/wiki/Generalised_compound","/wiki/Homeostasis","/wiki/Carbohydrate","/wiki/Protein","/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA","/wiki/Lipid","/wiki/Dynamic_reserve","/wiki/Starvation","/wiki/Biomass","/wiki/Autotroph","/wiki/Allometry","/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)","/wiki/Egg_(biology)","/wiki/Respiratory_rate","/wiki/Calorimetry","/wiki/Isomorph","#Assumptions_of_the_standard_model","#Extensions_of_the_standard_model","#Dynamic_energy_budget_theory_and_body_size","#See_also","#External_links","#References","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&veaction=edit&section=1","/wiki/Foetus","/wiki/Developmental_biology","/wiki/Homeostasis","/wiki/Heat","/wiki/Dioxygen","/wiki/Carbon_dioxide","/wiki/Ammonia","/wiki/Allometry","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&veaction=edit&section=2","/wiki/V1-morph","/wiki/V0-morph","/wiki/Synthesizing_Unit","/wiki/Syntrophy","/wiki/Biotechnology","/wiki/Aging","/wiki/Tumour","/wiki/Toxicant","/wiki/No_effect_concentration","/wiki/Risk_assessment","/wiki/DEBtox","/wiki/Biodegradation","/wiki/Syntrophy","/wiki/Cell_(biology)","/wiki/Organism","/wiki/Population","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&veaction=edit&section=3","/wiki/Reproduce","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&veaction=edit&section=4","/wiki/Allometry","/wiki/Comparative_physiology","/wiki/Evolutionary_physiology","/wiki/Metabolic_theory_of_ecology","/wiki/Power_law","/wiki/Scaling_law","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&veaction=edit&section=5","http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/index.html","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&veaction=edit&section=6","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&oldid=549502075","/wiki/Help:Category","/wiki/Category:Metabolism","/wiki/Category:Developmental_biology","/wiki/Category:Systems_biology","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Dynamic+energy+budget&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Dynamic+energy+budget","/wiki/Dynamic_energy_budget","/wiki/Talk:Dynamic_energy_budget","#","/wiki/Dynamic_energy_budget","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&veaction=edit","/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_energy_budget&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf12/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Dynamic_energy_budget","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Dynamic_energy_budget","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPag
