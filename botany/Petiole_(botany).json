The petiole is the transition between the\nstem and the leaf blade, and usually has the same\ninternal structure as the stem. Outgrowths appearing on each side of the petiole\nare called stipules. Leaves lacking a petiole are called sessile, or clasping when they partly surround the stem. Clasping leaves\nof the Poaceae have an extra structure called the ligule. 'Petiolate' leaves are\nones where the petiole connects to the leaf before its apex.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Petiole_(botany)","recorded":1376427888,"links":[],"instances":["botany"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant morphology"],"headings":["Description","Etymology","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["sessility","botany"]],"members":["sessility"],"related":["Stipule","Botany","Leaf","Plant_stem","Stipule","Sessility_(botany)","Poaceae","Ligule","Compound_leaves","Hydrophyte","Latin","Diminutive","Hyponastic_response"]}
